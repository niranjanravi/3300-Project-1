He don't know how they fuck for really keep
He ain't never lose a doggy, he's fuckin' innocent
He ain't have the weapon 30 times just to keep just to kill a bitch
Them tattoos and that jury don't make you hardest
And your coochy rap about it in your car garage
You fake as hell, fake it, counterfeit
You a fart under pressure, tell quicker than your boss
Time to hit your hood with a bodyguard
They so not squad, young'uns, they will pull your cars
U ain't bout that life

Big ball and no bite, big mouth and no fight
Flip this motherfucker fo' that bitch fine
No matter but he ain't right
Earned my G stripes as I'm livin'
I'm a robbin' it
Hell when Chelsea needs slap automo
I'm with your friend Lucas
He ain't 'bout that life, he ain't 'bout that life
We know the boy gets talkin'
200 hundred rounds in your project
At that same store barkin'
I told what the fuck? They said Diddy is fucked
Then all that false clappin', that gang bangin', throwin' the wrong sets up
Manicurin' their nails and their toes
2020, get his... in his faces
I'm 'bout that life, Yodi
I'm a thin it like a Tobe
The brick squad and the Dante Marv
Who the fuck it?

You ain't 'bout that life, You ain't got no stripes
You talked and took but you ain't tryna fight
Let this fucker sell it all his life, he's so
Aks somebody brought in the hood his whole life
Talkin' 'bout you got prize, you work at Popeye's
Ain't never sell no work, he was too scared to go outside
Get up in that booth and he Tony Montana
Ain't got a hundred grand, clamin' you king of Atlanta
You ain't 'bout that life, young bitch you got a invention
Virgins, don't let 'em fuckin' get you when you're splurgin'
You ain't 'bout that life hoe, same signome
Cause I can tell how you talk, it ain't signals
U ain't bout that life
So everything that growlin' a dollar you see over words, you never turn my back on y'all
U ain't bout that life

For this 3 hundred carats

This shit don't make no sense [x4]
I say this shit don't make no sense
This pay roll in my pocket
This shit don't make no sense
I say this shit don't make no sense
This tunnel in my club
This shit don't make no sense
I say this shit don't make no sense
Man these youngers are killers
Tell these streets that we made it
Untouchable niggas we was born to be hated
Me and Sosa ain't telling we get money together
Hood niggas we eatin' and we down for whatever
See they're scared of my niggas
They wouldn't give him a bind

Taking pictures in the hood
Some of these niggas be snitches
Pilla talking with hoes
While I'm counting my riches
Bad bitches be calling

I can't forgive to flip a whip and make a pie
Molly hide you can shit it in my eyes
Give her dick 'cause I know she let it ride
Guess she fuck me anywhere anytime

A squad shine bright in the dark like us Because We the Glory boys, we just hope you know that
We full of ignorance and we a bunch of shootas
Because We the Glory boys, we just hope you know that
We full of ignorance and we a bunch of shootas

Mais ils auront jamais le flow du dur-Gra
ValidÃƒÂ© par les taulards et les soldats
Ta meuf crie tellement "Sheguey" que quand tu la baises, elle pense ÃƒÂ  moi
Quand elle me voit, elle s'met des doigts
J'rentre dans sa chatte comme un cheval de Troie
Quand j'en ai marre, j'appelle Felom, Nyda
Histoire qu'on la baise ÃƒÂ  trois
Ouais nÃƒÂ©gro, j'dis que d'la merde
Nique sa mÃƒÂ¨re, vas-y bouge la tÃƒÂªte
Fume de l'herbe, vas-y pousse les pecs
Ouais nÃƒÂ©gro, vas-y pousse les pecs'

Riding in the Range Rover, all I do is change clothes

Bouncing like a kango, but they wanna hang tho

Don't let us catch you lacking, catch your ass in traffic
Shit is gon' get hectic, riding with that Mac-10
Woop, there go the police, act like you don't know me
Smoking 'til I OD, bankroll never folding
I done seen some bitches, pulled up then I get them
Tell them bitches get it, if you wanna fit in
Four thousand for this Moncler, I buy 20 a year
Don't give a fuck if the sun come, bitch I'm the sun's son

Riding up Lawrence, see it then I cop it
Pistol, I'ma flop it, fop it, pop it
Riding in a red truck, looking like a damn Blood
Suwu to them damn bloods, cuz to them damn crips
My niggas coming doing hits, don't give no fuck 'bout no camera
When I look in the mirror, I see a rich nigga
Remember when I was broke on Front Street, selling D
And catching felonies, now get back to me, melodies
Aye, still Dipset
Since 20-O-8
Now it's 2014
Bitch, and I get my own cake
Get my steak and I eat my own plate
I smoke my own blunts

Ball got some fine bitches too
Ball got some dime bitches too
Me and Bally Ball riding in Lambo
Lambo like 'ello

Done it all, bitch, I'm mellow
Pull strings like a chello

You ain't talking green don't call my cello
'Bout green then I push it to the metal
Then I roll me a 'rello

All I fucking do is ride Nascar
Niggas wanna take that that far
Shooting them guns like Rambo
Loaded up with that ammo
With a suitcase full of that marijuana

Lil bitch, I got P's for the low
Lil bitch, I got keys to the door

The police pulled me over, I'm shooting shit up

Who would ever thought that diamonds cost this much
Who would ever though that nigga's can't be trusted
Who would ever thought that girl wouldn't give it up
Who would ever thought bitches wouldn't ride far
Who would ever thought I would never kill the chorus
Who would ever though that I would taste peace again
Who would ever thought that I would never be the man
Who would have ever thought that I would be Almighty So
Who would have thought I'd drive these cars and fuck all these hoes

Bang bang
Gang gang
Bang bang
Gang gang
Bang bang
I ain't missin' you at all
Since you've been gone away
I ain't missin' you
No matter what my friends say
I was sittin' at home, I was rollin' a blunt
I was thinkin' 'bout you been dead gone
Got a call from my boys like, "Your cousin is dead"
I was like, "He couldn't have had his head on"
I be suited, I be booted, ready for anything
Give me the chance then I'll head home
I pull up, get that check, when I leave best believe
On the freeway I'm headin' home
I done partied, I done sipped Bacardi
Rollin' with Blood, we done crashed all the parties
We done rode Ferraris, rode Lamborghinis
Now only thing that I care about is breathing
Why I go hard, Blood be the reason
Wouldn't want me to quit even if I was bleedin'
Gotta take charge, every four seasons
Every month, every day and every weekend
I ain't missin' you at all
Since you've been gone away
I ain't missin' you
No matter what my friends say
I bet you remember posted on the block
All we knew was shots
We ain't really know about the guap
All we knew was Glocks
I remember when you called my phone tweakin'
You got your first deal, you was geekin'
Remember when I got my first deal, I hit you on the phone
Like for now I am Chief Sosa Yeezus
You was like, "Nah you're Almighty"
Almighty don't like nobody
Went from shootin' .40 cals, now we gettin' 40
Bands for a show and we stay 'til the morning
God chose us, and gave it up
Dead or alive, niggas still hatin' us
It's the end of the quarter, I'm a rock with sticky D
I'ma pass the ball to you and you can hang it up
I ain't missin' you at all
Since you've been gone away
I ain't missin' you
No matter what my friends say
No matter what I might say
No matter what you might say
No matter what I say
No matter what your friends say
No matter what our friends say
No matter what, what I say
No matter what, what I say
Just know this, I miss you Big Glo

Rolling blunts and popping pills
That Molotov, that bomb for real
I'm nodding off, unconscious
Wake up nauseous, god damn alcoholic
Pulling ten grand out my wallet
Know they 'bout to judge me
I been sitting at the crib, I'm sick of counting money
Bored of being rich as fuck, tried every single drug
It's not exciting anymore once that first million come

On the phone with my accountant
It feels good to be this wealthy and well rounded
We got you surrounded)

Cause I'm on now, gotta keep it near me
Cause niggas are smile, but really befriend me
Bitches act down, but really ain't enemy
They just want me count, heard I got then milli's

Where I'm from you gotta walk 'round with your gun
But I made it out, just to get some money

Now I'm riding what I want
Fuckin' any thot I want

Remember when I was broke

They thought I was a joke
