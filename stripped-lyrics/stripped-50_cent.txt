 I had five hundred grams in fifty-fifty-eight bags
Four-hundred Benz, eight-thousand in cash.
Then the ball dropped, gun popped, banks got blast
I make it so hot, one shot'll melt your ass
Got popped up, cried till my eyes turned red
Told myself in the mirror nigga you ain't dead
I'm far from eccentric, I'm so psychotic
I don't need you to shoot for me, nigga I got it
When you see me in the hood muh'fucker don't talk to me
'Less you wan' talk about usin' a hawk for me.
When Al blew Black away I had 'em on some stupid shit
Then my rap shit worked, now I'm super stupid rich
All I do is stunt now, I'm so Maybach
There I go frontin' again I meant to say laid back
Go 'head move wreckless get banged for necklace
I serve 'em with the semi feed 'em a clip for breakfast.
You want some, come get some
Nigga it's murder one, when I toss my gun
You might see me let it off, you might see me run
But you won't see shit, time the police come huh
You want some, come get some
Nigga it's murder one when you see my gun
I jus' squeeze and squeeze 'til the whole clip done
You jus' bleed and bleed till the police come, huh you want some
I got a 8th of dope left half a pound of purple
Shooters in my circle, try me I let 'em murk you
Got more guns than a gun store, beefin' what you want boy
You wan' be nice to me you wan' shoot dice with me?
You want a ace on purpose why you so nervous?
Nigga we from the same hood we come from the same shit
You got gonorrhea too, we fucked with the same bitch
Gettin' money is necessary so me I'm a visionary
And I'm sayin' that house should be a crackhouse
Now see it how I see it, or I bring the straps out
The Tec and the mack out the Sig and the Taurus
The coke and that heckler then nigga we warin'
I let my pistol speak for me and all of 'em foreign.
Click-clack comprende I'm criminal minded
Toss money in the sewer bet nobody find it
Till it's rusty and fucked up, forensics have fun what?
You want some, come get some
Nigga it's murder one, when I toss my gun
You might see me let it off, you might see me run
But you won't see shit, time the police come huh
You want some, come get some
Nigga it's murder one when you see my gun
I jus' squeeze and squeeze 'til the whole clip done
You jus' bleed and bleed till the police come, huh you want some
Come get it, I'm strapped now, I'm with it
Come get it!
Huh, you want some?
Come get it, I'm strapped now, I'm with it!
Fuck that nigga!
Huh, you want some?

Nigga try and come play me
Better come on your A game, ay mayne - AY!
Niggaz try to move on me
I cock the heat, cause a melee, melee - AY!
Witness this shit, niggaz get hit AY!
Run with it spit, don't get hit by the A.K.
Take cover quick, niggaz on that shit AY!
Come broad day they'll get at you with the A.K.

Niggaz think they know me, I be on some other shit
My baby mama don't know me, I be with my other bitch
I blow a stack, I get it back, you keep in check, I get the gat
Then you wan' chitter-chat, now what kind of shit is that?
Strip club, shake it shake it, toss it up, make it rain
Semi tucked, I let it buck, I shoot the shit up out your gang
Find out who you're fuckin with cause I ain't for the sucker shit
Cut you like the cocaine, niggaz stay in yo' lane
I'm a muh'fuckin heavyweight, you ain't in my weight class
And me I'm movin heavy weight, get gone with your light ass
Me I'm so official, pearl-handled nickel
plated nine-nine, your life's on the line


I don't give a fuck who outside, now listen
I don't give a fuck who get hit, I ain't missin
I come through that muh'fucker wavin the chopper
113th Precinct ain't enough to stop us
Niggaz shot at me before I got away, popped from a block away
Sucker niggaz be right there on one foot 'til I rock away
Next day I popped up, told niggaz it's my turf
They done seen the gun smoke, they done found my shells burn
Sabrina baby special, they treat me like a misfit
I squeeze (rnnn-rnnn) I risk it, I risk it
Different class of nigga, my hand around the trigger
Don't make me do it, I'll do it you stupid nigga

You think about money when you think about me huh,
That's what my ex, my ex you don't want to be her,
She used to have the beemer, now she own a sneaker,
I had her eating lobster now she eating pizza,
I think about Easter when I think about Keyshia,
Shorty stay fly that's why I keep her,
Round like the reefer, brown Mona Lisa,
She good if I leave her she got her own visa,
Think about them when you about frontin'
Think about stuntin' when you think about me,
I'm the boss Bentley or the Porsche,
Overseas, see jet skis slide across,
I love the way you dress,
Now take it off,
Put your legs high on my shoulders of course,
I'm racing through your mind but you already lost,
I'm at the finish line and your the friend of mine,
Come on lets ride
Just a lil' bit
Every now and then
God damn girl, we used to be friends
Just a lil' bit
Just a lil' bit
Just a lil' bit
Just a lil' bit
I think like a hustler,
I'm thinking bout a shipment,
She thinking I'm her husband,
So she thinking bout commitment,
Its like Paul McCartney stuck in my head,
Fell in love with a bitch walked away with one leg,
She ain't even have to run to get away with the bread,
That's some fucked up shit
Think about that kid,
I'm thinking what this bitch thinking when she take me to court,
I pay my child support, what the fuck she want,
This relationship, shit its too much for me,
I wanna fuck your friends and live comfortably
She wanna shine and blow minds on shopping sprees,
She should have what she wants just not for me,
I'm thinking bout my future she part of my past,
She don't care bout me she just want some cash,
I'm thinking damn girl, we used to be friends,
How did sh-t become all about ends
Just a lil' bit
Every now and then
God damn girl, we used to be friends
Just a lil' bit
Just a lil' bit
Just a lil' bit
Just a lil' bit
Do you think about me?

I know you think about me,

Just a lil' bit
Just a lil' bit
Just a lil' bit
Do you think about me?
(Remember when you told me,
That I would always be special to you darling)
I know you think about me,
You were so special to me
Do you think about me?

Till the day you die... if your one of the poor ones you just got to work hard

Man I wasn't the shooter I was never on the scene
So if they do forensics then they will know it wasn't me
Theres no need for a lie dictor cuz I aint sayin shit
The more you talk the higher your chance is your doin a bid
Today I read the paper and it said tru life caught a case
They said they found the victim with a knife stuck in his face
I spoke it Michael Vick and I told him I'm happy he home
You tell them crackers sorry nigga then you get back on

Have me casin' out your crib, tryna pop your fuckin' noodles
She was twenty I was twelve, man my Nana said she raped me

Since high school, nigga I ain't got no friends
Got two Three-Eighty's like the Ying Yang Twinz, ah
That's spot clickin' till the D's run in
Then it's bail money and lawyer fees you got to have ends
Freshman year I had that C-B-R Hurricane
In a ill Herringbone I got 'um swingin' Heroine
I shoot a nigga in a heartbeat I ain't no chump
Then you can run Forrest run retard when I dump
They take kindness for weakness, niggas don't respect that
So me I'm where that Reuger, that Pump and that Tech at
Some look at me I'm on now, I thought we was rich then
Shit man, but you had like, twenty bricks in Richmond
We was in Cocaine heaven, I was fishscale dreamin'

First Country caught a body, then country caught a body then
I popped a couple niggas, then country shot everybody
It's cold blooded, it's real shit you got to love it
Tre-Eight Snub it, and don't think nuttin' of it

Then days went by, then days went by, then days went by
I was tired of havin' shit
Then days went by, then days went by, then days went by

He a lucky muhfucker I bet he make it to heaven
My Grandpa drunk, my uncle Rock drunk
My uncle Champ pump crack, smoked my fuckin' stash up
I had two-hundred and fifty grams stashed on the porch
I mean I'm what you call smoke man, I'm what you call snort
First the VCR went, then the T.V. went
He stole outta mommy purse, she thought it was me kid
I ain' ask her for no money son cause I was out hustlin'
She was lookin' at me sideways like I'm a thief or somethin'
That hurt me, c'mon son that wouldn't hurt you
I pistol whip that nigga till his face was purple
I need anger management, see I hold on to a grudge
The same way I hold on to that nickel-plate Snub
The Lord don't have imperfections baby
So I think I'm perfect the way he made me
Some say I'm cool, some say I'm crazy
Some say I ain't shit, some say I'm amazin'
I seen niggas gettin' rich

Now me, I get it in, I get it in
Me, I get it in, I get it in
Now me, I get it in, I get it in
Me, I get it in, I get it in
Look as soon as I step in the club
I swear, my nigga, you can feel the attention shift
Started around twelve, ended up around two
I better leave with more hoes than I came here with
I can't be responsible for what I say
Or I do when I talk intoxicated
Shorty say I told her I love her
I put her out the next mornin'
Sayin' bitch I must have been faded
I don't know what you heard about me
But the word about me is that I'm no trick
I'm no sucker, I'm no chump
I be in the VIP with my niggaz 'round me
Sayin' y'all can have whatever you want
Me, I get it in, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday
Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday
That's Sunday, Monday, Tuesday
Wednesday, Thursday, Friday we get it in
I need a drink, give me a drink
I need a drink, shorty, give me a drink
I need a drink, give me a drink
I need a drink, shorty, give me a drink
I hate to say I told you so
But I told you so, I go hard when it's time to play
Shorty get to droppin' it low
Like the dancers do in the Go Go in front of me
She know I like to see her dance
She get to breakin' it down, we get the bouncin' outta control
Because I got a hell of a flow
We got paper to blow my whole clique pop bottles galore
It's no secret the hood done peeped it
When we come through, son, we look like bread
My '89 grind make my old nine shine
Like we been movin' bricks 'round this bitch for years
I say, I get it in it's because I get it in
Now shorty there a eight but her friend near a ten
I finna spend my G, she fuck with me, I'm in to win
I'm cooler than her ma, then we do this shit again
Me, I get it in Sunday, Monday, Tuesday
Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday
That's Sunday, Monday, Tuesday
Wednesday, Thursday, Friday we get it in
I need a drink, give me a drink
I need a drink, shorty, give me a drink
I need a drink, give me a drink
I need a drink, shorty, give me a drink
Na, na, na, na, now me, I'm the life of the party
A little bit of juice, little bit of the gin
A little bit of Moet, bottles of the Rose
Feel a little buzz then I'm gettin' it in
Now me, I get it in, I get it in
Me, I get it in, I get it in
Now me, I get it in, I get it in
Me, I get it in, I get it in
Man I'm gonna do my thang, get up!
It's crazy in the club when I'm in there man, get up!
Trust me homie I'm not playin', get up!
Now get on the dance floor off the chain
I say get up!
I came to bring you that California love
And a lil' New York hatin' it's all of the above
I'm not playin' I'm sayin' I'm off the chain
You niggas better follow the instructions
I said get up!
I ball till I fall
I stunt till I drop
I'm off the show room floor
Not the used car lot
You buy a bottle
I buy the bar
I make every other week feel like Mardi Gras
When I get in to it
I get in to it
Everybody can't do it the way I do it
I make it rain, rain
Till the sun come out
A nigga playin', playin'
We make the guns come out
Now, my question is
Who they gonna blame
When I'm back number one on the Billboard again
Shit, shift now the game done change
Since Mike made Thriller and Prince made Purple Rain
I guess I make the kids wanna slang
And NWA made the West Coast bang
Nah it's just music, man it's just music
Now get your ass on the dance floor and move it
I have the savoir faire
I'm the reason everybody here
I say get up!
I make it hot, I make it hot in here
Your feet hurtin' I really care
I said get up!
I want to see you, I want to see you move
And get all into the groove
I said get up!
I'm getting money man I really don't care
Let me see you put your hands up in the air
I said get up!
Girl, you look good
I want to get to know you better
You look good in them jeans
And them red stilettos
You got a Bentley
Coupe booty baby
I want to drive
See I tell you what mileage is
When I'm inside
I'ma take you for a spin
You know round and round
Switch gears till your love come down
I take you to the point of no return
If you listen you learn
Just how a nigga earn
I got money to burn
While the Gap Band play
She dropped the bomb on me
It's up and down
And up and down
Gracefully
Rick James would have said she a brick house
Or Fifty you should go home to see
What that bitch bout
I found out she like it how I like it, huh
Back it up' get cha some
I know how to get you sprung
Tune you up' use your tongue
Under the hood it's so good
She said it's so good
Goddamn I'm so hood
Nigga wattup?
I have the savoir faire
I'm the reason everybody here
I say get up!
I make it hot, I make it hot in here
Your feet hurtin' I really care
I said get up!
I want to see you, I want to see you move
And get all into the groove
I said get up!
I'm getting money man I really don't care
Let me see you put your hands in the air
I said get up!
And get into it
You are now rocking with the Unit
I said get up!
And get into it
We gonna show you just how we do it
I said get up!

I can hear your heartbeat, you're scared, yeah yeah
I can hear your heartbeat, you're scared
I can hear your heartbeat, you're scared, yeah yeah
I can hear your heartbeat, you're scared
You see, I'm a psycho, a sicko, I'm crazy
I said I got my knife pulled, I'll kill you if you make me
They wanna see me shot up, locked up and cage me
I'll come back bigger, stronger and angry
Look look, I've come from a different crew
You fuck with me, I'll get to you
A clip or two, I'll put through you
'Cause I ain't got shit to do
Pistol poppin', a pussy drop
Drama never ever stop
Eenie meenie miney moe
Now tre pound or 44
Pick a strap the Tec, the Mac
The hawk I'll stab it in your back
I'll blow your brains, I know your name
And where you rest, I'll make a mess
The hollow tips hit ya chest
Call for blood to E-M-S
Come pick you up
You know you fucked when
You get on a stretcher
'Cause I'll come in to ICU
To see you off to heaven
The system I done been through it
There's nothing new to me
They locked me up they let me out
You seen this in the movies
The criminals be criminals
Why they up in corrections
They come home, get a 9
Nigga commit trying perfection
It's murder when they found the gun now they doing ballistic
But they can't find a fingerprint the shit's going terrific
Get so close to your target that it's really hard to miss it
You see, I'm a psycho, a sicko, I'm crazy
I said I got my knife pulled, I'll kill you if you make me
They wanna see me shot up, locked up and cage me
I'll come back bigger, stronger and angry
Man, these are average raps, I'm keeping the savage batch hidden
The can of whoop ass with the Shady/Aftermath lid
You pop off the top, it's like opening vats of acid
Beat the Octomom to death with a Cabbage Patch Kid
Attack a snatch, yeah, there's something to jack a batch in
Impregnated then shoot up the embryo sack with Mac-10s'
Triplets, quadruplets, and a couple of back-to-back twins
Dead fetuses falling out all over, Jack is back again
The Ripper's at your service, girl I can see that you're nervous
But I barely scratched the surface like my last batch of girlfriends
That I buried in my fucking backyard still trying to dig their way out
I foam like an attack dog, how late you wanna stay out?
It's past your curfew when it's dark, I'm searching for you in the park
Shady murdered him another virgin, he just hit his mark
He met his quota for the month, they found Dakota all rolled up
Inside a bag, he probably dragged the body for about a block
Disappeared without a trace, no DNA, no not a drop
'Cause me and Dre and 50 we will never get caught by the cops
CSI, they hate us, but they gotta give a lot of props
The drama pops, grab the butcher knife from off the counter tops
You see, I'm a psycho, a sicko, I'm crazy
I said I got my knife pulled, I'll kill you if you make me
They wanna see me shot up, locked up and cage me
I'll come back bigger, stronger and angry
I'm as ill as can be
My appeal is to serial killers what a pill is to me
Killing so villainously
Still as maniacal on the NyQuil and psycho as Michael Myers
You know what we're like on the motherfucking mic so try us
And you're gonna find out what the fuck we're like with pliers
It's operation time, they got him hooked up to wires
Squeezing, he bleeding wheezing, breathing he half dead
He must ain't know, but now he know how Shady the Math is
Even murderous tactics get better with practice
Lead showers, gun powder, feel the talons burn burn
School of arts, Julliard, you better learn learn
Chris Reeves in his grave, yeah, homie, turn turn
I'm debating mutilating the lady
You've been waiting for Shady and Fif, ain't no duplicating it, baby
There's a baby in the dryer, there's a torso in the washer
I think it might even belong to Portia when I tossed her
Arms and legs in the garbage, cause the rest of her, I lost her
Her head is in the disposal with Jessica's, I squashed her
I put her on the ringer and hung her over the wash tub
When I'm through with Ricky it'll be blood that he'll cough up
The hard rock I'll soft up, get caught up and get washed up
In Detroit or Norfolk, witness this shit, end up nauseous
Look deep in my eye, see many many men die
I swing gem stars faster than a Samurai
You see, I'm a psycho, a sicko, I'm crazy
I said I got my knife pulled, I'll kill you if you make me
They wanna see me shot up, locked up and cage me
I'll come back bigger, stronger and angry
I gave her books to read, fed her mind with knowledge
Gave her street smarts, shit you can't get in college
She's a reflection of me so you know she the shit
If I'm a star she a star, if I'm rich she rich
That's my dog
I tell her stay she wanna go, I tell her go she wanna stay
That's my dog
You know a bitch don't usually mean nothing to me, that's right
But that's my dog I go left, she go right, I go up, she go down
She couldn't listen that, she ain't around
So ungrateful screaming "I hate you"
She must got amnesia, bitch I made you
Now just think, just think that could've been you
Just think, that should've been you
Yeah, with me, I share the world with you
But you ain't ride with a rider so I ain't fucking with you
Say, say, say girl, come here, no, you, no, her, yeah, you, go
The reason you didn't get dick
Because you got your nose up your ass like your smelling your shit
But tonight you met your match
'Cause I be smelling my shit too, now how you like that?
You could've had this dude and anything you choose
And now girl you lose cause I ain't fucking with ya

Shopping spree's, drop top hair blowing in the wind

Living lavish, instead it's your girlfriend
But you tripping while we sipping
In the back of the club big tipping
She say it hurts when you supposed to win then you lose
You were supposed to be sure, baby, you was confused
I had a thing for you, I had a ring for you
House, cars, kids and a pet name for you
Pussycat, told you I'd make it, you ain't believe
I guess cause coming up was hard it was easy to leave
Now think about it, maybe I'm right, maybe I'm wrong
Either way shorty, life goes on
When you around, my smile's a grin, my thoughts are a sin
You ask me can we try again, I ain't fucking with you
It's on, the club jumping, I'm trying get my liquor and
You wanna suck the dick again, I'm staring at your thicker friends
I guess I'm like Will Smith in "Pursuit of Happyness"
In my hood, we all hustle and in pursuit of the same shit
Now just think, just think, that could've been you
Now just think that should've been you with me
I share the world with you
But you ain't ride with a rider, so I ain't fucking with you
Say, say, say girl, come here, no, you, no, her, yeah, you, go
The reason you didn't get dick
Because you got your nose up your ass like your smelling your shit
But tonight you met your match
'Cause I be smelling my shit too, now how you like that?
You could've had this dude and anything you choose
And now girl you lose cause I ain't fucking with ya

Shopping spree's, drop top hair blowing in the wind

Living lavish, instead it's your girlfriend
And it ain't no other way to put it except
I know you understand it girl, it's so
But you see us in the back of the club
Popping bottles and it could've been you, but nope
{"Alright, are you ready?"}
 Fuck that

These niggaz is green, these niggaz is green
I'm talkin in codes, pardon me what I mean
When you see him it's a go, go 'head nigga go
Catch him in a hoopty, squeeze hit him through the do'
These niggaz is green, these niggaz is green

When you see him it's a go, go 'head nigga go
Catch him on the front porch by his momma do'

Hit his fitted cap, he won't get a chance to Twitter that
I make the Ruger sing a song, bullets hum to you
You better have God wit'chu when I come to you
I'm a grimy nigga, I said some simple shit
You's a dirty nigga with syphilis on your dick
I catch you I'ma wash you up, line you, spit-shine you
Leave you right there in the street, where niggaz can find you
Die nigga die, fly pelican fly
When I pull it eat a bullet, don't question me why
What's the laws of the jungle, I'll show you what the gun do
My bad, what the shell do; you rot until they smell you


Get green son get him, cut his head
He didn't even see it comin, he sleepin that's what he did
Get biz, niggaz actin like it ain't what it is
Let the knife work push the blade up in his shit
Let Doc come sew him up, gang signs throw 'em up
In my hood growin up - you pussy or you bout it
You shootin or you runnin, the police comin
Niggaz get at you, you get at them or you don't mean nuttin
Niggaz walk tough, even walk like warriors
On some G shit they get to singin like Gloria
Now come clean, tell us what you told the D's
Matter fact don't tell us shit, motherfucker hold this


Yeah, feels like summer to me
Expect it nice and hot
40 Day, my bad my bad
Family Day, I be in the projects

Y'ALL KNOW I WAS GONNA GET ON THAT SHIT?
YEAHHH!
I don't really think she want me back then, she want me now
She can play games all she wants, she cannot pretend, she like my style
I got swag now, I got paper, I'm rolling in the dough, I'm caked up
I got swag now, I got paper, I'm swimming in the dough, I'm caked up
I was a real bum now I'm really rich, kid
I come through the hood in some really, really sick shit
The Rolls, the roof gone, your flows, they're lukewarm
It's why you're not me; nah-nah-nah-nah-nah
She like the kid, my lifestyle what she wanting
Bottle after bottle by the bar, I be stunting
It's Gucci this, Gucci that, Gucci hat
Big doofy gat, hit you in your kufi hat
You know me, I told your ass in '03 "Get Rich or Die"
G-5 I fly, write my name in the sky
Pick an island on the map, I been to it
Shorty wanna try anal, her friends do it
Wrists rocked up shining, flawless diamonds
You could hardly see the face on my Audemar time and
On that J.T. shit, me I'm bringing sexy back
Louis belt wrapped around right where the TEC be at
I don't really think she want me back then, she want me now
She can play games all she wants, she cannot pretend, she like my style
I got swag now, I got paper, I'm rolling in the dough, I'm caked up
I got swag now, I got paper, I'm swimming in the dough, I'm caked up
Getting paper's my objective, yup, now your chain gone
One false move and clap, now your brain's gone
You like me, you aight with me; me? I'm into me
I destroy my enemies even if they're kin to me
Do 'em like the Kennedy's, ching-ching that's mo' bread
Say something slick out your mouth I'll come for your head
She likes me more than you can imagine
Bad bitch, look like she fell up out a pageant
Closest I'mma get to heaven in this lifetime
Is right below her waist in between her thighs
Call her Pussycat, that's my nickname for her
And I ain't got to buy shit or run game on her
See when I stunt she stunt, we stunt together
Oh, you don't like how that sound? Aw nigga whatever
We both rock Bugarri, both push Ferrari's
I go so hard in the paint, I'm sorry
I don't really think she want me back then, she want me now
She can play games all she wants, she cannot pretend, she like my style
I got swag now, I got paper, I'm rolling in the dough, I'm caked up
I got swag now, I got paper, I'm swimming in the dough, I'm caked up
You want me? I want you, plug one? Plug two
I'm infinitely special, girl
The Lord's gonna bless you if you do what I tell you to do
You want me? I want you, you want a Benz? I'll buy two
You should want me like you want success
Girl, with us together we'll be better than the best
Why settle for less?
I don't really think she want me back then, she want me now
She can play games all she wants, she cannot pretend, she like my style
I got swag now, I got paper, I'm rolling in the dough, I'm caked up
I got swag now, I got paper, I'm swimming in the dough, I'm caked up

Come through hit you up, I'll make a crime scene perfect
Niggas talk about me all the time behind my back
They don't talk about me in my face because I'm strapped

{"Doesn't really matter - us"}
From here on out it's my way

187 in motion
Hammer cocked when I'm coastin, yeah
187 in motion
Hammer cocked when I'm coastin
Redrum, redrum
Fuck with me it'll be murder one
Redrum, redrum
One shooter, ten shots, one gun
This is redrum
{"Oh it's too late, oh it's too late"}

If I hit him I'll hurt him, I just catch him and murk him
I'm not sittin here waitin for him to come back - naw!
Soon as I spot him I got him, I'ma run up and drop him
Get that P-90 poppin, nigga hold that - uhh!
I get the gun and they runnin, niggaz know me for dumbin
I got a good reputation, what the fuck can I say
Some of these niggaz is bitches, yeah most of 'em snitches
So I don't let 'em know it's me, doin dirt when it's me
I know just how to work it, I can make it go perfect
Have the homicides sittin there, scratchin their head
To me a victim's a victim, you could pay me and pick 'em
Then I hunt him down and take his head off like I dare ya


I bet you think that I'm vicious, catch you huggin and kissin
While the love's in the air, I put a hole in your heart
Plus so now that I'm missin, I'm a fuckin magician
You might find my DNA, all over your broad
Me and my cannibal methods, I eat you niggaz for breakfast
See the cannon respect it, nigga take off the chain (now!)
Robberies turn to murder, I do shit you ain't heard of
Change my mind and just pop you, in a blink of an eye
I know you thought I was bluffin, but to me this is nothin
Now you can lay there, leakin, go 'head curl up and die
You tell God when you see him, I'll be happy to meet him
I went to service this evenin, he forgives, not I


It's murder
Nothin but murder
NYPD, LAPD, NYPD (When it's on that's who you get, huh?)
NYPD, LAPD, NYPD (That's your motherfucking clique, huh?)
NYPD, LAPD, NYPD (You a motherfucking snitch, huh?)
NYPD, LAPD, NYPD
Niggas wanna shine like me (me), rhyme like me (me)
Then walk around with a 9 like me (me)
They want to do it 3 to 9 like me
And they ain't strong enough to take 9 like me
Ayo, you think about shitting on 50, save it
My songs belong in the Bible with King David
I teach niggas sign language, that ain't deaf, son
*click* *click* you heard that? That mean run
Ask around, I ain't the one you wanna stunt on, pa
Pull through, I'll throw a fucking cocktail at ya car
From the last shootout I got a dimple on my face
It's nothing, I can go after Mase's fan base
Shell hit my jaw, I ain't wait for doctor to get it out
Hit my wisdom tooth *huck-too* spit it out
I don't smile a lot cause ain't nothing pretty
Got a purple heart for war and I ain't never left the city
Hoes be like "Fiddy, you so witty"
On the dick like they heard I ghostwrite for P.Diddy
You got fat while we starve, it's my turn
I done felt how the shells burn, I still won't learn
Won't learn
If you get shot and run to the cops you not like me
You ain't got no work on the block, you not like me
It's hot, you ain't got no drop, you not like me
Like me dude, you not like me
If you get shot and run to the cops you not like me
You ain't got no work on the block, you not like me
It's hot, you ain't got no drop, you not like me
Like me dude, you not like me
Mama said everything that happened to us, was part of God's plan
So at night when I talk to him I got my gun in my hand
Don't think I'm crazy cause I don't fear man
Cause I fear when I kill a man God won't understand
I got a head full of evil thoughts, am I Satan?
I been could've killed these niggas, I'm still waitin'
In the telly with two whores, Benz with two doors
32 karats in the cross, no flaws
You see me in the hood, I got at least two guns
I carry the Glock, Tony carry my M-1
Hold me down, nigga, OGs tryin' to rock me
D's waiting for my response to lock me
This is my hustle, nigga, don't knock me
You need some shit with a banana clip to try and stop me
I'm the one
If you get shot and run to the cops you not like me
You ain't got no work on the block, you not like me
It's hot, you ain't got no drop, you not like me
Like me dude, you not like me
If you get shot and run to the cops you not like me
You ain't got no work on the block, you not like me
It's hot, you ain't got no drop, you not like me
Like me dude, you not like me
See, I done been to the Pearly Gates, they sent me back
The good die young, I ain't eligible for that
I shot niggas, I been shot, sold crack in the street
My attitude is gangsta so I stand some beef
You wanna get acquainted with me, you wanna know me
From 3 point range with a Glock, I shoot better then Kobe
See a nigga standing next to me, he probably my Co-D
See a bitch getting in my whip, she probably gon' blow me
See the flow is like a .38, it's special y'all
Country boy tell ya, I'm finna blow
I'm more like a pimp than a trick, you know
See, I'm in this for the paper, but I don't love the hoes
Niggas broke in the hood worried about mines
Grown ass men wearing starter piece shines
You know them little pieces with the little stones
Got little clientele fiends call your cell phones
When the gossip starts I'm always the topic
You too old for that shit, dawg, won't you stop it?
Shorty, I been watching you watching me
Now tell me what you like more, my watch or me?
If you get shot and run to the cops you not like me
You ain't got no work on the block, you not like me
It's hot, you ain't got no drop, you not like me
Like me dude, you not like me
If you get shot and run to the cops you not like me
You ain't got no work on the block, you not like me
It's hot, you ain't got no drop, you not like me
Like me dude, you not like me
I need you to pray for me and
I need you to care for me and
I need you to want me to win
I need to know where I'm heading cause I know where I've been
The flow is bone crushing, it's nothing, I come up with something
Come through your strip fronting, stunting
It's something you want, 745 chrome spinners
Haters hate that I'm winning
Man, I've been hot from the beginning
Motherfuckers envy the kid, control your jealousy
Cause I can't control my temper, I'm finna catch a felony
Pistol in hand, homie, I'm down to get it popping
Once I squeeze the first shot you know I ain't stopping
'Till my clip is empty, I'm simply
Not that nigga you should try your luck with or fuck with
Hollow-tip shells struck you with your bones broken, guns smoking, still locing
What nigga, lay your ass down, paramedics get you up feeling
Right now I'm on the edge so don't push me
I aim straight for your head so don't push me
Fill your ass up with lead,so don't push me
I got something for your ass, keep thinking I'm pussy
Right now I'm on the edge so don't push me
I aim straight for your head so don't push me
Fill your ass up with lead,so don't push me
I got something for your ass, keep thinking I'm pussy
I done lost my bigger nigga and I didn't cry
To young to understand the consequences of a man
Living a lie, I gotta get that money
I'll be damned if I'm bummy
Gotta watch my back around these niggas cause they funny
20 years of watching my mama's tears got my heated, heavily weeded
Smoking that bong cause I need it
These niggas don't want me balling, they want me buried
Bogged in the dirt from shots flurried
Laying with bugs under my shirt
I got plans to hop up in that Hummer
Cause I'm a stunner, I sit back and wonder
When them angels gonna call my number under
My chest is a heart of a lion
I ain't lying, bounty hunters got me flying
With my iron, high as a giant
I'm running from nothing, my stomach is touching what I'm clutching
To give you more than a concussion, end of discussion
My blood is colder so I'm bolder
Hennessy and soda, hood on my shoulder
Look in the mirror, I see a soldier
Right now I'm on the edge so don't push me
I aim straight for your head so don't push me
Fill your ass up with lead,so don't push me
I got something for your ass, keep thinking I'm pussy
Right now I'm on the edge so don't push me
I aim straight for your head so don't push me
Fill your ass up with lead,so don't push me
I got something for your ass, keep thinking I'm pussy
These are my ideas, this is my sweat and tears
This is shit that I saw with my eyeballs, my ears
This is me, who's gotta be what you see on TV
What you hear on CD, what appears easy
Man these teenie boppers see me on these magazine covers
In these beanies and these rags living fantasies
Fronting like it's all fun and games 'til the shoot 'em up bang
And you see your brains hang and you see we ain't playing
Ain't saying we ain't laying down at night and ain't praying
I bullied my way in this game, man, I'm done playing
Man, I'm done saying that I'm done playing
I'mma start laying into these motherfucking cocksuckers
There's no way I'm back down like a god damn coward
I can't, how would I look as a man bowing to his knees?
Like the mad cow disease, let somebody lash out at me
And not lash back out at 'em, please
Oh, whoa, yo, ho, hold up, oh no, not me, not Marshall
You wanna see Marshall? I'll show you Marshall
I try to show you art, but you just pick it apart
So I see I have to start, showing you fucking old farts
A whole other side I wanted to not show you
So you know you're not dealing with some fucking marshmallow
Little soft yellow, punk pussy, whose heart's Jello cause
Right now I'm on the edge so don't push me
I aim straight for your head so don't push me
Fill your ass up with lead,so don't push me
I got something for your ass, keep thinking I'm pussy
Right now I'm on the edge so don't push me
I aim straight for your head so don't push me
Fill your ass up with lead,so don't push me
I got something for your ass, keep thinking I'm pussy

If I fell off tomorrow would you still love me?
If I didn't smell so good would you still hug me?
If I got locked up and sentenced to a quarter century,
Could I count on you to be there to support me mentally?
If I went back to a hoopty from a Benz, would you poof and disappear like
Some of my friends?
If I was hit and I was hurt would you be by my side?
If it was time to put in work would you be down to ride?
I'd get out and peel a nigga cap and chill and drive
I'm asking questions to find out how you feel inside
If I ain't rap 'cause I flipped burgers at Burger King
Would you be ashamed to tell your friends you feelin' me?
In the bed if I used my tongue would you like that?
If I wrote you a love letter would you write back?
Now we can have a lil' drink you know a nightcap
And we could go do what you like, I know you like that

Are you my soul mate? 'Cause if so, girl you a blessing
Do you trust me enough, to tell me your dreams?
I'm staring at ya' trying to figure how you got in them jeans
If I was down would you say things to make me smile?
I treat you how you want to be treated just teach me how
If I was with some other chick and someone happened to see?
And when you asked me about it I said it wasn't me
Would you believe me? Or up and leave me?
How deep is our bond if that's all it takes for you to be gone?
We only humans girl we make mistakes, to make it up I do whatever it take

The hoodrats they say "He so crazy"
The snitches they say "He tried to spray me"
That's what you get for trying to play me
The aftermath and my wrath is so shady
No matter how you try you can't stop it
I catch ya stunting in the Bentley CoupÃƒÂ© cockpit
If you a pimp why ya hoes stay outta pocket?
Front and find out how my P-40 Glock hit
"50 you need some help?"
Chill, Yayo I got this

They swear to God that it's me selling the choppers

From the tellie in ten minutes I'll make you a believer
Tongue touch ya, I'll have ya shakin' like you havin' a seizure
I make hits about what I do in my leisure
G-Unit gang, can't another clique out there see us
Niggas lip sync the lyrics cause they wanna be us
Groupie hoes from the hood they be trying to G us
Trying to holla at the kid every time they see us
Girlfriend quit pretending, I'm the nigga ya love
And I ain't got to say nothing, you know that I'm thugging
Put my hands on that ass and ya say that I'm bugging
We family, baby, kissing cousins
Now look what the riff raff done drug in
For the cheese my degrees is hotter then ya oven
I'mma New Yorker, but I sound Southern
And we sip DP 'till the Don stop bubblin'
After we play, ok, go to ya husband
I know you like my style
But how much do you like my style?
You like how I break it down
Wanna get rich I'll show you how

You're not really, really ready
The drama will have ya ass in trauma, boy
You're not really, really ready
My knife flip open and then I gets to poking
You're not really, really ready
Them shells start popping and bodies get to dropping
You're not really, really ready
You think ya ready, ya not
Really really ready

Shells hit your chest, go out your back, mane
See me I put in work, man, I been doing dirt for so long
Then niggas get laid out
Niggas run through my crib to holla at the kid
That's when I start bringing them thangs out
Then we go through the strip hanging up out the whip
Dumping clips off at their whole clique, mane
When witnesses around they know how we get down
So when the cops come they ain't see shit, mane
My soldiers slanging 'caine, sunny, snowy, sleet or rain
Come through the hood and you can cop that
I'm sittig' on some change, G-Unit that's the gang
Come through here stunting you get popped at
I love to pump crack, love to stay strapped
Love to squeeze gats, but you don't hear me though

Love to bust shots, but you don't hear me though
I love to pump crack, love to stay strapped
Love to squeeze gats, but you don't hear me though
I love to hit the block, I love my two Glocks

Just for the simple fact they know that I'm a rider
I got a hell of a aim, I keep on telling you, mane
I swear ain't nobody gon' find ya
When I get lifted I'm tempted to tear your block up
Your niggas can't run cause I'm behind ya
Me and Chili in your city with a couple nine-milli's
You better stay in line, bro
Cause if I walk it I'll talk it, you know we'll walk up and pop it
I love the sound of gunfire, bro
Right now we smacking 'em with platinum
And they hate it cause we made it, that's what we keep that iron for
I represent it cause I'm in it, UTP until I'm finished
Juvenile, they can't stop us and I admit it I live it
I'll knock a baller off his pivot with this motherfucking chopper
I love to pump crack, love to stay strapped
Love to squeeze gats, but you don't hear me though
I love to hit the block, I love my two Glocks
Love to bust shots, but you don't hear me though
I love to pump crack, love to stay strapped
Love to squeeze gats, but you don't hear me though
I love to hit the block, I love my two Glocks
Love to bust shots, but you don't hear me though
My twenty-inches spinning, you always see me grinning
And you hear niggas call me grimy
They hit me with them bricks and I ain't pay 'em shit
I'm outta town, they can't find me
When I come back around, man, I'mma back 'em down
I run up busting that TEC, mane
If you ain't got a gun and you can't fucking run
My advice is you hit the deck, mane
But if you get away and come back another day
My soldiers'll leave you wet, mane
Cause we know where you be and we know where you stay
And we'll come checking through your set, mane
Man, you heard what I said, now get it in your head

Push me nigga, see what I'm about
I was a snotty nose, nappy head, dirtbomb nigga
Sayin' I cant wait till I get a little bigger
Half the niggas jumped me, bumpin' my head
Thinkin' I wish I had a gun I fill a nigga with lead
Took a kitchen knife, I'm finna poke me a nigga
Wishin' I had a gun so I could smoke me a nigga
Sold my first five quarter gram pieces in the alley
Where Bizzy had the Bondeville and Kev had the caddy
Now those were the days, where crime really pay
Nine milly spray, got the fuck out the way
The shootout, the shootout
The bricks went fast, robberies went bad, niggas got blast
Niggas kidnap Drew granpa kid
Came through and shot Ms Leak in the head
Wonder why I got a gun so I can get down for mine

Hood rats to get layed, money to get made
Yeah, yeah I had a dream I was rich
Woke up broke, gun in my hand
Sayin' "Damn!" this dope cost 60 a gram
Have to find me a nigga, line me a nigga
And say "Give it up kid, before I put one in ya wig"
Picture me thirsty, ridin' round foamin' out the mouth
Sayin' "I don't get on" I'ma lay a nigga out
Now diamonds are beautiful, pearls are precious

Got my ass whooped in Spotford but never that now
When my name in ya mouth, better watch how you talk

Man if I get a shot, I could make it to the top, damn what if?
If I got on some pretty boy s*** like Puffy
N****z in the hood, man they just wouldn't love me
If I wore a suit every day like Jay-Z
N****z would think I blew up my f***in' head and went crazy
If I put diamonds in my teeth like Baby
I wouldn't stand a chance of tryin' to sell like Shady
If I put out bulls*** joints like AZ
Every chance n****z get, they'd try and play me
But I move around with a little 380
A n**** try to stunt, a n**** get sprayed be
If I smoked weed all day like Snoop do
I'd see the world different through my dilated pupils
If I bust dance moves on you like Usher
N****z did say, "50 that ain't gangsta, f*** ya"
Man I'ma just keep doin' what I do
'Cause n****z can't do me, better than I do, ha, ha
Man I watched the sun go up but come down, sayin' what if?
Man I watched the tide roll in and roll out, sayin' what if?
Homey I play the block tryin' to get my packs off, sayin' what if?
Man if I get a shot, I could make it to the top, damn what if?
What if I had blockbuster flicks like Will Smith?
And all the backpack n****z loved me like Mos Def
I'd probably be a cool a** n**** like Ice Cube
Picture me in this flick right now lookin' so cool
What if I was a low key n****, just laid back?
Hustle to keep a homey 'round, somebody to hold the gat
Man what if Halle Berry was my next baby moms?
S*** I'd give that child support up with no problems
If I caught a case and jumped bail I'd get caught
'Cause I'm that n**** everybody know from New York
But if I was the new rap n**** you didn't know
You'd be sayin', "Damn that kid got a sick flow"
What if I just cruised through your hood on 22's
Bumpin' Curtis May field or Marvin, somethin' smooth
And if I let the top down on the Azure
Yeah that'd make you sick to your stomach I'm sure, ha, ha
Man I watched the sun go up but come down, sayin' what if?
Man I watched the tide roll in and roll out, sayin' what if?
Homey I play the block tryin' to get my packs off, sayin' what if?
Man if I get a shot, I could make it to the top, damn what if?
Yeah, ladies and gentlemen
I'll like to thank you all for coming out tonight
It's my third album, third tour, third time's a charm
Girl when I go, I really like it
When you roll with me, I got doe,
The-kinda-paper-you can-blow with me,
And babe I know, that money ain't everything,
But its for sure, you pay for nothing
When you fuck with me, when I go

Follow my lead, baby I could be all you need, if you follow my lead
Follow my lead, I'll hold you down put your trust in me, baby follow my lead
Follow my lead, I think god made you for me, follow my lead
Follow my lead, I'm the one girl in time you'll see
If you follow my lead
Don't listen to the rumors they say 50 fuckin' crazy
50 don't know how to treat a lady
They wrong, I like you a lot I don't wanna hurt you
But I call a square a square and a circle a circle
So if you act like a bitch, I call you a bitch then hang up
Probably call you right back and shit
And I have to say baby I apologize, cross my fingers god forgive me for
Tellin' lies
Like Janet Jackson say "I miss you much, I really wanna feel your touch"
And smell your scent, baby I could pass the day, watchin' you model lingerie"
I wanna spend the night tonight shorty if its okay
You can be my beyonce I'll be your jay
Ha ha
I gotta great sense of humor, first I'll make ya smile then I whoo ya!
You know how I do ya, or do ya?

After seven hours new york, to London,
You wonderin' whats gonna be the next stop
I told you, im'a don you gonna know I'ma don
After you shop 'till your feet hurt in Milan
Now take a picture these are moments you can cherish
They say the scene of me was made for lovers out in Paris
Ask a fan about me they say "50 we love 'em"
Without them, there's no me so I love them
Man their the reason I exist, the reason I insist
I'm never less then the best so perfection I guess
That's why niggas are stress'd, I'll pass the test
Every time I drop, I'm burnin' hot
So I don't care if she loves me or loves me not
As long as I enjoy the time that we spend
I ain't lookin' for commitment, we could fuck and be friends
Matter fact we can do it right in the back of my Benz
I get it done with speed


I'm from city to city to shop the show
See me I been glidin' across the globe
I hustle hard to get the grib fa sho'
So when I make time to call you, you should pick up the phone
Tell me, whats on your mind when you're alone
Have ya touchin' on yourself, girl all in the zone
Now if I told you all
What things I say would I be wrong
Well then I wouldn't be right
Matter fact I'd be on the next flight
Tryna get it on with you tonight
Do the things you like
Touch the right spot, have ya piped and hot
While the wind blow through your hair in the drop
Just lay back, relax to the sounds of the sex
And let me to what I do until you climax
You can go straight to sleep after its all over
In the mornin' roll over and we can start over
Something special, unforgettable,
50 Cent (cent), Justin (tin), Timbaland (land), god damn (damn)

'Cause I can send my homies through to blast them
Stick 'em with the hump, or just slash 'em
"Now fool are you crazy?" is what we ask 'em
But back to me and you shorty, decide, think

Back up, chump, you know Biggie Smalls grips it quick
And kicks it quick, you know how black niggas get
With the hoods, fatigues with the boots with trees
Smokin' weed, flippin' ki's, makin' crazy Gs
Hittin' buckshots at niggas that open spots on the avenue
Take my loot and I'm baggin' you
Pimpin' hoes that drive Volvos and Rodeos
Flash the Roll, make her wet in her pantyhose
Damn, a nigga style is unorthodox
Grip the glock, when I walk down the crowded blocks
Just in case a nigga wanna act out
I just black out and blow they motherfuckin' back out
That's a real nigga for ya
We the realest, nigga

Don't try to act like you don't feel a nigga
Biggie, yo' nigga, 50, yo' nigga

Rough very not your ordinary, we watch you get buried
That's a real nigga for ya
Get mad, do a quarter, flip the script and rip your lawyer
Spit at the D.A. 'cause fuck what she say

Up Northbound, first stop, Watertown and fish scale
Where the hand scales are real ill
You'll be a super Hoover, doo doo stain remover
Yo, G, pass the buddha

50 Cent and B.I.G., my nigga
Don't try to act like you don't feel a nigga
Biggie, yo' nigga, 50, yo' nigga

When I was young, my M.O. was to go hand in hand
And even my P.O., she called me the 'Ginger Bread Man'
I cut ya new case and tell her ass catch me if you can
Don't let your people feel you're awkward, I tame, I'm not lame
Get gassed up to get blast up
Real B.I.G. Style, watch the kid break it down
Check it, thou shalt not fuck wit North Seed Papa
50 Cent, I'll break yo' punk ass off propa
There's no place like home, New York, New York
I run this city and now I dance around like Diddy
Niggas is giddy 'til they act smack silly
Or spray wit the Mack Milly, they don't want drama, really
Pushy niggas get hard, lip syncing my lyrics like Milli Vanilli
Even the hood, they feel me, I'm on fire
Niggas out in Philly, they feel me, they bump my shit
Even bootlegged, you know, bump my shit, bitch
We the realest, nigga
50 Cent and B.I.G., my nigga
Don't try to act like you don't feel a nigga
Biggie, yo' nigga, 50, yo' nigga
Squeeze the trigga, leave a nigga fo' sho'
I got 50 Cent, I got G-Unit
D-Twizzy's in this bitch with Obie Trice
So watch what you say before you call our name
If you say one more thing, it won't be nice
Here we go, I shoulda known
I was bound to get pulled into some bullshit sooner or later
You little haters are too jealous of us to love us
You ain't it, G-Unit made it and Obie's comin', D-Twizzy's comin'
You sick to your stomach
50 percent is 50 Cent
The other 50 percent is who's color skin it is
Well, if you're even considering takin' our label down
You better find our building and fly a fucking plane into it
But I ain't tryin' to get too intricate into it
I'm just tryin' to give you a little hint for your own benefit
'Cuz then it's gonna get to the point
Where it escalates into some other shit
Then I'ma flip, then I'ma get to stompin' in my Air Force Ones
Won't be able to tell if it's two pairs or it's one
It's gonna feel like there's so many feet kickin' you
You think that Nike just made these into cleat tennis shoes
I don't know what it is or what it could be
But I get a woody when these pussies try to push me
Thinkin they gon' put me in the position to pickle me
Y'all tickle me pink, I think I'd just rather have Pink tickle me
Hickory dickory dock, tickety tock tickety
A little bit of the diggity dock diggity
Mixed with a little bit of the jiga jig jiga
With a small pinch of Biggie
Look at me, I'm just the bomb diggity
We the realest label
Don't try to act like you don't feel our label
'Cuz we gon' fuck around and kill your label
Obie, D-Twizzy, G-Unit, 50, Shady Records
We the label fo' sho'
We the realest label
Don't try to act like you don't feel our label
'Cuz we gon' fuck around and steal your people
Obie, D-Twizzy, G-Unit, 50
We gon' kill yo' fuckin' label fa sho
Shady in the place to be seen
And I got what it takes to rock the mic, right?
Still watch what you say to me punk
'Cuz I'm off probation in less then 6 months
Ain't it amazing how crazy the hood done made me?
Feels like my emotions are froze, I stay G'D up
It's the things I done seen and shit I been through
That make my heart turn cold, I stay G'D up
I'm a gangsta, you find out for sure
If you ever step on my toes, I stay G'D up
When I'm hangin' out that window with that AK
Fillin' your punk ass with holes, I stay G'D up
Cocaine, heroin, ecstasy, marijuana
I'm mule on that Greyhound from NY to the Carolina
Paper chase, different name, same face, don't catch a case
My road dog's on parole, his baby girl's four years old
We play the block, pistol cocked, you could shoot or get shot
Kill you for your crack spot, take everything your ass got
Semi-automatic spray, bust back or run away
Niggas talkin' in the hood, we'll handle this another day
In November, you make my shit that should dead you
You can catch for Christmas, I'll send you a gift
Niggas'll come and leave your ass twisted
Them hollow tip shells, burn, baby, burn
See niggas get merked up, babies born and the world turn
I seen it all crystal clear, so, I keep my pistol near
Heart's never full of fear, homie, I stay well aware
Of what's going on around me, motherfuckers want me dead
I go wit a smile on my face when it's my time, kid
Ain't it amazing how crazy the hood done made me?
Feels like my emotions are froze, I stay G'D up
It's the things I done seen and shit I been through
That make my heart turn cold, I stay G'D up
I'm a gangsta, you find out for sure
If you ever step on my toes, I stay G'D up
When I'm hangin' out that window with that AK
Fillin' your punk ass with holes
Lil nigga, I done paved the way, y'all should thank 'em
But if you think otherwise, bring your boy over here, so I can spank 'em
I'll put an end to your career, bitch
Before you speak on 50, buy a .40 and a spare clip
These niggas gassed up, gettin' to used to rap
Like I won't give 'em more bloodclots than Supercat
Niggas'll snatch ya, I'm like a bat catcher
I'll give a sign and they post somethin' at cha
'Round here, niggas die of hydro
And even when it ain't 4th of July, it sound like pyro
You smart enough to creep then lay your dumb brains down
The pound'll spin you around like the young James Brown
I know I'm hot but, hey, I'm icy too
Rocks'll ll hit you from a block away like a beat from Dr. Dre
We're takin' over this year, K's and the soldiers is here
Everyone knows it's a scare
Ain't it amazing how crazy the hood done made me?
Feels like my emotions are froze, I stay G'D up
It's the things I done seen and shit I been through
That make my heart turn cold, I stay G'D up
I'm a gangsta, you find out for sure
If you ever step on my toes, I stay G'D up
When I'm hangin' out that window with that AK
Fillin' your punk ass with holes
My papa never bothered to show me what it was to be a man
He'd just pop another bottle and smoke up a half a gram
I would hop in my Impala and ride all through the night
That gave my homeboy light, so when you do it, do it right
My fingernails still filled with cocaine residue
I still got the heart to go and bust me a head or two
No other solution, you think we hollerin and hootin'
Until you wake up and then you got ta hear 'bout these shootings
I take a pull from [Incomprehensible] when he put the clip in my pocket
Before I take another bullet, I'm gonna pull it and pop it
And if it's beef my nigga, then let your guns do your talkin'
The graveyard has got plenty room for a coffin
They say that we responsible for boostin' the crime rate
They say that we the reason that these young niggas buyin' weight
But I'm gonna keep this glock on my waist 'til my dayin' days
It's nuttin' but a G thang, G-Unit and Dr. Dre
Ain't it amazing how crazy the hood done made me?
Feels like my emotions are froze, I stay G'D up
It's the things I done seen and shit I been through
That make my heart turn cold, I stay G'D up
I'm a gangsta, you find out for sure
If you ever step on my toes, I stay G'D up
When I'm hangin' out that window with that AK
Fillin' your punk ass with holes, I stay G'D up

Everytime I'm in the kitchen, you in the kitchen
Let me finish this brick, 'fore you put that fish in
Listen, I know we just came from fishin
But I'm on a mission, you see, there's money that I'm missin
I got 'em posted, so the move and I'm gonna murder y'all
You and all the trouble goin through by servin y'all
And only cause my man heard of y'all
Other than that, shit, y'all won't get served at all

I went from oodles and noodles to lobster and shrimp
I went from bare bubble coats, to brand new minks
And yo my neck upgraded, my wrist's upgraded
I stay C of F, I ain't got time for Jacob
I'm still on the strip, tryin to get my grims off
Nigga tryin to flip and its a Mexican stand off
I put a hole in your grill, with the nine mil
Dressed in all black, lookin for souls to steal

Little bit of dust, little bit of cocaine
Little bit of dro, little bit of heroine
A littlE bit of ecstacy
That's why your bitch want to be next to me
We sell a little bit a everything

I put the two Mags, up to your doo rag
And rockaby baby, I'm in the blue Jag with new tags, in case you wanna chase
I never knew that, the impact, comin up out a Desert Eagle
A make a nigga wob and wiggle screamin call my people
We got these fiends pourin liters, and they shootin needles
Need to be takin your connection, cause we got it cheaper
Shit I ain't new to this, I met this air stewardess
Who knows the ins and outs on how to get it in and out, nigga

Ya if I put a dress code all black, nine hows and a laser
And the party is an ink pen, bottle, or a razor
Your hollerin for praise ya, catch me in the hood with a model named Taysha
And the swallow game major
These cowards ain't gangsta, they tellin you lies by sellin you dreams
And they ain't fill ins, they fiends
Plus they rat, and it's too hot to chill in the sun
My pops 39 years old, and still on the run


Wodie what you want, you want dope, you want coke
Wodie what you want, you want X, you want dro
Shit you got beef, I got a tec and a fo'
You feelin' hot and moist, I even get you a ho
If you don't got no whip, I get you a car
If you don't got no skills, I get your some more
My nigga we don't cut it, we serve it raw
Got anythin you want, play us awful hard

My 22's bling, so niggaz scheme
745i clean, this little shell nigga, fuck a triple beam
Coffee pot to cook coke, Joe to smoke, I was born to loc
Method cut the coke, 50 no joke
I ain't "Scarface", no women, no kids, I don't give a fuck
Better teach that bitch, and that little nigga to duck
With a P-90 Ruger, I put shots all through ya
If you survive you gonna feel what talent do to ya
They say I'm grimey, Im greasy
I make a 187 look easy
Fuck that, I lay my murder game down
Push me nigga, see what I'm about
I was a snotty nose, nappy head, dirtbomb nigga
Sayin' I cant wait till I get a little bigger
Half the niggas jumped me, bumpin' my head
Thinkin' I wish I had a gun I fill a nigga with lead
Took a kitchen knife, I'm finna poke me a nigga
Wishin' I had a gun so I could smoke me a nigga
Sold my first five quarter gram pieces in the alley
Where Bizzy had the Bondeville and Kev had the caddy
Now those were the days, where crime really pay
Nine milly spray, got the fuck out the way
The shootout, the shootout
The bricks went fast, robberies went bad, niggas got blast
Niggas kidnap Drew granpa kid
Came through and shot Ms Leak in the head
Wonder why I got a gun so I can get down for mine
You need that, out on the grind all the time
They say I'm grimey, I'm greasy
I make a 187 look easy
Fuck that, I lay my murder game down
Push me nigga, see what I'm about
They say I'm grimey, I'm greasy
I make a 187 look easy
Fuck that, I lay my murder game down
Push me nigga, see what I'm about
It was kangos, caselli shades, boombers and corn brades
Do rags on the waist, brass knuckles, switch blades
E-mass to get paid, new shells to get sprayed
Hood rats to get layed, money to get made
Yeah, yeah I had a dream I was rich
Woke up broke, gun in my hand
Sayin' "Damn!" this dope cost 60 a gram
Have to find me a nigga, line me a nigga
And say "Give it up kid, before I put one in ya wig"
Picture me thirsty, ridin' round foamin' out the mouth
Sayin' "I don't get on" I'ma lay a nigga out
Now diamonds are beautiful, pearls are precious
I hit ya in ya bitch, both go for ya necklace
I'm so wreckless, I play the semi drunk off henny
Wipe your blood off the shines run and sell em to Benny
Fuck with me, ya niggas know Boo Boo get bizzy
They say I'm grimey, I'm greasy
I make a 187 look easy
Fuck that, I lay my murder game down
Push me nigga, see what I'm about
They say I'm grimey, I'm greasy
I make a 187 look easy
Fuck that, I lay my murder game down
Push me nigga, see what I'm about
I gave jus' a buck 50 ask him If I cut niggas
Shootouts in Bedford ask him If I bucked niggas
Four fifth they call me Boo Boo, the accident baby
Hennessy and Cocaine, those remedies made me
My eyes don't cry, I'm a fatherless child
Got my ass whooped in Spotford but never that now
When my name in ya mouth, better watch how you talk
Send yo punk ass to therapy to learn how to walk
I bust a clip Ill hit ya hip
I'm take your shit
That's how the esse's play, for that s.s.k
Your probably heard through the grape vine, I'm good out Watts
Bulletproof shit, cruisin' through the Compton blocks
I'm the beast from the east, but I play on the west
In the drop by myself with my gun and my vest
And you niggas best be on your best behaviors
I was bread for this shit, front I'ma blaze ya
They say I'm grimey, I'm greasy
I make a 187 look easy
Fuck that, I lay my murder game down
Push me nigga, see what I'm about

I come through to see my little nigga with the llama
Yeah, this somethin' special why'know, somethin' epic
Lloyd Banks, you know
'Cause a nigga thuggin' don't mean he don't
Don't wanna see you smile baby
I wanna be the reason you smile
I wanna be the reason you smile
I wanna be the reason you smile
After you wipe away your tears and dry your eyes
I'm gettin' the feelin', you wanna take revenge
From the conversations, we have and the way it ends
You wanna discuss me in front of your lady friends
That's why it's just me and my Mercedes Benz
It all depends, maybe if we make amends
We can start from scratch
Learn to control your temper and remarks in fact
We plan to be platonic with our hearts in tact
So every time we separate, somebody's marchin' back
You're amazing in the sack, eyes slanted like you're Asian
But you're black, God bless whoever gave you alla that
If you seen her from the back, you'd understand why dis feel like that
And ain't a flaw to her toes, the Lord knows
Her pussy good enough to miss award shows
And I ain't gotta say nothin', she just knows
By the way I look at her to take off all her clothes up and down
Whenever I'm not around and you feelin' down
Let the thought of me be

I don't wanna see you frown, like them kids watch a clown
I wanna bring you joy and be

Baby, you know my style, you know how I get down
I provide by any means to be

We done been through ups and downs, had drama for a while
I'm just happy I'm around to be

The main reason I been lookin' at you pitiful
What about the half of this shit I done did to you
Violated and tiptoed into a crib or two
I've come clean to be a bigger individual
Even though you're busy boo, the evening's when I visit you
Kinda makes me feel lucky, 'cause I see niggaz
When you tease 'em with your physical
She wanna rack up her brooms, I ain't got no more room left
Wild drama, section 8 princess
My foreign chick bad, but she been stressed
'Cause it's hard to communicate
'Cause she don't speak-a no English
I been around the world from state to state
But now I'm back bustin' in your bathroom
Got you laughin' in your shower cap
Let's get it on
'Cause I'm leavin' in a hour, fly-through
Don't matter she's mad, even when I holla back
All I really need your attention for a while
And, I bet you I can make you smile
Whenever I'm not around and you feelin' down
Let the thought of me be

I don't wanna see you frown, like them kids watch a clown
I wanna bring you joy and be

Baby, you know my style, you know how I get down
I provide by any means to be

We done been through ups and downs, had drama for a while
I'm just happy I'm around to be

Whenever I'm not around and you feelin' down
Let the thought of me be

I don't wanna see you frown, like them kids watch a clown
I wanna bring you joy and be

Baby, you know my style, you know how I get down
I provide by any means to be

We done been through ups and downs, had drama for a while
I'm just happy I'm around to be

I wanna be the reason you smile
I wanna be the reason you smile
I wanna be the reason you smile
After you wipe away your tears and dry your eyes
The Transformers More Than Meets The Eye
Autobots wage their battle to Destroy the evil forces of the Decepticons
The Transformers More Than Meets The Skies

Yeah, Look I got one in the back,
I got one in the front,
I make em do what I say.
They tell me say what I want
I tell em
get your money girl or just stop breathing...
cause if it aint about that dough Ii aint about it neither
see a gangster like myself I get my paper from woman
man your woman probably out there with some paper to give me
Listen, your looking at a real pimp ask my old women
and there tell you no remote, I control women
I'm a whole load put me in the game women
if he aint paying then he shouldn't be playing I'm saying
broke dudes only make jokes funny
I make more then I can fit in this quote honey
Unquote come sun soak with me ma
fly you down here and lay you up in my beach house
and if you smile at my girl, I'll make her smile back

Powerful impact, Boom from the cannon
I'm strong in the hood, I'm aight on the scanning
figure my next joint should do at least double
but right now I'm trying to get at mami with the bubble
she know who the God his, she seen the Charpard kid,
no security guard so I'm easy to target but
bring it back, if you coming for war then bring your AK
if you coming to gamble then bring a stack
and I don't even need that nonsense
I'm trying to watch honey bring it back like a DJ contest
so I just blew the lizm
then I started division
her hip thighs and ass are coming out of them true religions
here ma, want a cup?
it's D-Block and wanna know what?
MH my niggas gun em up
and we aint trying to carry it

Back up chump, you know Biggie Smalls grips it quick
And kicks it quick, you know how black niggas get
With the hoods fatigues with the boots with trees
Smokin weed, flippin ki's, makin crazy G's
Hittin' buckshots at niggas that open spots
On the avenue, take my loot, and I'm baggin you
Pimpin hoes that drive Volvo's and Rodeos
Flash the Roll, make her wet, in her pantyhose
Damn, a nigga style is unorthodox
Grip the glock, when I walk down the crowded blocks
Just in case a nigga wanna act out
I just black out, and blow they motherfuckin back out
That's a real nigga for ya
 (2x)
We the realest nigga
50 Cent and B.I.G. my nigga
Don't try to act like you don't feel a nigga
Biggie yo nigga, 50 yo nigga
Squeeze the trigga' leave a nigga fa' sho!

When we smoke spliffs, we pack four-fifths
Just in case dread wanna riff
He get a free lift to the cemetary, rough very
Not your ordinary, we watch you get buried
That's a real nigga for ya
Get mad do a quarter flip the script, and rip your lawyer
Spit at the D.A. cause fuck what she say
She don't give a fuck about your ass anyway
Up North found first stop for the town
of fist-skill, where the hand skills are real ill
You'll be a super Hoover doo-doo stain remover
Ha hahhh, yo G, pass the ruler


When I was young my M.O. was to go hail the Henny
And even my P.O. she called me the Ginger Bread Man
I cut ya new case, and tell her ass "catch me if you can"
Don't let your people feel your awkward
I tame I'm not lame
Get gassed up to get blast up
Real B.I.G. style watch the kid break it down
Check it, thou shalt not fuck wit North C. Papa
50 Cent, I'll break yo punk ass off propa'
There's new place like home, New York - New York
I run this city, I don't dance around like Diddy
Niggas is giddy, till they act smack silly
Or spray wit the Mack Milly, they don't want drama really
Pushy niggas get hard lip syncing my lyrics like Milly Vanilly
Even the hood they feel me {*gun cocked*} hah! I'm on fire!
Niggas out in Philly they feel me, they bump my shit
Even bootlegged you know, bump my shit, bitch!

Yeah! Ha Ha!

Man everywhere I go, I mean like everywhere I be
I hear niggaz runnin they mouth, you should hear how they talk 'bout me

I know Boo Boo I mean 50 he a grimey nigga
50 shot my brother I'm a find that nigga
We don't see his punk ass unless he on TV
Yeah he did my brother dirty but he don't wanna see me
Member Rydell from KP thought he was his man
Put him on the table to bag up he beat him for grams
How you think he got that money for that Chalk Gray Land
That nigga robbin and stealin everything that he can

Man everywhere I go, I mean like everywhere I be
I hear hoes runnin they mouth, you should hear how they talk 'bout me

Yeah I know Curtis, he used to fuck with my friend
Used to come through my projects pick her up in the Benz
Niggaz from my buildin always used to ask about him
Like she in and out of town right that niggaz get down right
I used to say, all I know, is the nigga get money
And you standin in my way, excuse me dummy
Ronda she told me that nigga a freak
And McDonald's ain't the only thing that he eat

Man everywhere I go, I mean like everywhere I be
I hear everybody runnin they mouth, you should hear how they talk 'bout me

I love 50 Cent, that's my dad
But even my mom talk about him bad
She says since he blew up, he changed for sure
He's really fascinated with these fancy hoes
I don't know why but there personalities collide
And my dad will swallow blood before he swallows his pride
You know the kids in my class they be sayin he's crazy
They just like him cause he rollin with Dr. Dre and Shady

Man everywhere I go, I mean like everywhere I be
I hear niggaz runnin they mouth, you should hear how they talk 'bout me

Man 50 fucked up, I mean real fucked up
He left us in the hood we fucked up
Still actin like he in the street tellin niggaz they can't eat
You know this motherfucker went and bought Tyson's crib
Got Bentley's, Ferrari's, and all that shit
He don't even come through to try and help niggaz out
That's the bullshit see what I'm talkin about

Man everywhere I go, I mean like everywhere I be
I hear everybody runnin they mouth, you should hear how they talk 'bout me

That's my Grand baby I love him I raised that boy right
He ran to me cryin sent him back out to fight
Put a battery in his sock go pick up a rock
You ain't a chump, you want your Grandma to think you a punk
Look at my first Grand baby, he is a big rap star
Bought me a house, diamonds, and a brand new car
I tought him what it takes, to go this far
Boy I'm the reason you are what you are

Man everywhere I go, I mean like everywhere I be
I hear everybody runnin they mouth, you should hear how they talk 'bout me
Man everywhere I go, I mean like everywhere I be
I hear everybody runnin they mouth, you should hear how they talk 'bout me
Don't even look at me wrong when I come through the hood
Ain't nothin' changed, still holla at my homies
And when I hit the block, I still will kill
And I don't want, nigga but I will
If I got to, kill
If niggas get to fuckin' around, if niggas get to fuckin' around
Respect come from admiration and fear
You can admire me or you can catch one in ya wig
You see the Testarosa the toaster's right on my lap
So if a nigga get out of line, a nigga get clapped
I got an arsenal a infantry, I'm built for this mentally
That's why I'm the general, I do what they pretend to do
Front on me now nigga I'll be the end of you
Forget ya enemies and think of what ya friends'll do
I drop a bag off, then let a mag off
The Heckler & Koch'll tear half of ya ass off
I'm not for the games I'm not for all the playin'
The hollow tips rain, when I unleash the pain
Get the message from the lions or get the message from the nine
Paint a picture wit' words, you can see when I shine
Put my back on the wall nigga watch me go for mine
I let twenty-one shots off at the same time, yeah
Don't even look at me wrong when I come through the hood
Ain't nothin' changed, still holla at my homies
And when I hit the block, I still will kill
And I don't want, nigga but I will
If I got to, kill
If niggas get to fuckin' around, if niggas get to fuckin' around
Where I'm from death is always in the air homie
Nanna love me so you know she say my prayers for me
I come creepin' through in the hood wearin' Teflon
Hit the corners motherfuckers get left on
Niggas know, if not they better check my background
Try and stick me I fill ya back wit' mac rounds
Ask 'Preme nigga 50 don't back down
I keep it funky like fiends in a crack house
Cross the line boy I'mma air ya ass out
Screw ya face at me I wan' know what that's 'bout
Nigga I know you ain't mad I done came up
And if you are, fuck you 'cause I ain't change up
The O.G.'s wanna talk but I don't know these niggas
And I ain't did no business wit' 'em I don't owe these niggas
A minute of my time, I get it 'cause I grind
All across the world like the globe's mine, yeah!
Don't even look at me wrong when I come through the hood
Ain't nothin' changed, still holla at my homies
And when I hit the block, I still will kill
And I don't want, nigga but I will
If I got to, kill
If niggas get to fuckin' around, if niggas get to fuckin' around
Konvict
Now tell me have you ever looked up at an instance
And seen a mac aimin' at'cha head mayne?
Before you know it life is flashin' reminiscin'
And ya body is drippin' and full of lead man
I done been there, I done cocked that
It ain't never been a question I'm 'bout that
Don't go there, you'll get cocked at
And if ya plan to fuck around then reroute that
You'll never catch me ridin' around on these streets
Without a couple metal pieces under my feet
Fully automatic weapons and loaded wit' dumb-d's
Stashed up under the carpet like a can of Sea breeze
50 don't make me ride on these niggas
'Cause I will kill, dip and hide on these niggas
50 don't make me ride on these niggas
'Cause I'll be long gone like the Ripper, so
Don't even look at me wrong when I come through the hood
Ain't nothin' changed, still holla at my homies
And when I hit the block, I still will kill
And I don't want, nigga but I will
If I got to, kill
If niggas get to fuckin' around, if niggas get to fuckin' around
Something special, unforgettable

In her fantasy, there's plain to see
Just how it be, on me, backstrokin', sweat soakin'
All into my set sheets
When she ready to ride, I'm ready to roll

From side to side, let the ride, break it down

Different style, different move, damn I like the way you move

From the couch to the counters in my kitchen

K-I-S-S-I-N-G
She was pregnant by me once glad she didn't have it
Cause I be paying child support now god damn it
Tish was my bitch, til she fucked my god brother
I was heated when I heard, wanted to go upside his head
It was Christmas I just bought the bitch a sheepskin kid
I was sick to my stomach nigga this is real shit
I ain't the sensitive type, I ain't sit around crying
I caught the bitch on the avenue and punched her in the eye
Call it puppy love Curtis and Janelle in the tree
K-I-S-S-I-N-G
D's came locked my ass up like a savage
Then came Doobie in the baby carriage
Imagine how it felt summer day pretty blue skies
I gazed mesmerized at her in with green eyes
I'm so into you baby we don't even got touch
That the type shit I say when I really want to fuck
Cause her cousin Tisha lived by baby ????????? forty
Sold crack before rap so everybody know me
Chase Jus down cut his head the motherfucker owe me
Vick's spinning, Cheek's was the hottest rapper in the hood
I ain't hate, but on the low I didn't think he was good
We wore Timberland boots, carhartt suits
You can tell a nigga paid, when his Filas shoes suede
Ock a ceaser or a fade kept a pistol or a blade
Try to flip a sixty two like every couple days
I get knocked I come home its all a part of the game
Catch a snitch, cut a snitch or put one in his frame
Its like every other summer I was back and forth to jail
Telling nanna I'm copping out, so I don't need bail
Just the convesary put the money orders in the mail
Call it puppy love curtis and Deawn in the tree
K-I-s-s-I-n-g
Call it puppy love
Call it puppy love
She came to see me on the alley, wrote me letters all the time
And I responded to the letters so she stayed on my mind
Told myself Ima grind
As soon as I get out that paper what I'm about
After four months home I had the Lan I shine
Two months later I copped the Benz my nine
Stay all cocked even when it hot, TAZ out
TNT on the block, make yourself get knocked
I just love em and leave em, I don't give a fuck
I mean she didn't give a fuck, she had a nigga in my truck
Call it puppy love Curtis and Shaniqua in the tree
K-I-S-S-I-N-G

One shot, one kill, what's the deal
Yeah, what's the deal
Listen lil' homie, when it rains it pours
Hollow tips and tallids, when it rains it pours
Get caught in may showers just because
Niggaz ain't playin', when it rains it pours
Niggaz get set up, when it rains it pours
End up wet up, that's when it rains it pours
It usually, goes down over money and whores
But lil' homie in my hood, when it rains it pours
Ain't nothin' changed, niggaz doin' the same ol' shit
Them new hollow tips in them same ol' clips
In the projects, niggaz fuck with the same ol' chicks
And some how, they still think that they game is so sick
Now from the rip, niggaz know I'm 'bout my grip
I don't trick, man I barely even feed a bitch
She say I'm stingy, I say, "I don't need you bitch"
Go 'head leave, see if I chase you, shit!
Tell yo' mammy, I catch her in the streets I'ma get her
She know I'm on parole, why she call police on a nigga?
She just mad, 'cause a nigga pockets on swole
When she ask to borrow some, I say hell naw!
I was tellin' the lil' homies all about this shit
To keep yo' mind on yo' money
And don't trust no bitch
Keke hit high notes, when them kids came
But her ass kinda fat, so niggaz treat her the same
This is real
Listen lil' homie, when it rains it pours
Hollow tips and tallids, when it rains it pours
Get caught in may showers just because
Niggaz ain't playin', when it rains it pours
Niggaz get set up, when it rains it pours
End up wet up, that's when it rains it pours
It usually, goes down over money and whores
But lil' homie in my hood, when it rains it pours
Blood stains on my stoop, when Akbar got shot
When homocide outside, nigga I'm not
This the third time them niggaz done circled the block
It's money out now yeah, but damn it's hot
They'll love to catch a nigga, on a direct sale
They say, "tell us who caught the body, or you goin' to jail"
Look, if you know the drill you stay the fuck outta dodge
And say what's happenin' to the captain
And say what's up to the sarge
Fuck bein' in a cage man, that shit for the birds
Charlie drunk, drinkin' wild irish rose on the curb
I know a spot full of niggaz tryin' to bet a few bucks
Hopin they number come out, they can have 'em some luck
?? Ace to the duece, and stumbled off mad
Lost his re-up money man, that's all he had
Magazine from the store, so he can look at the cars
And do pull up's in the park, on the monkey bars
Mad as fuck
Listen lil' homie, when it rains it pours
Hollow tips and tallids, when it rains it pours

Me, I don't know nothin 'bout takin the stand
I ain't never got a nigga ass stuck in the can
Nah, I don't know nothin 'bout dro or hash
Coke, dope, ex, dust or crystal meth
Nah, I'm just tryin to rap to get some cash
Keep the Hip Hop Police off my ass
Nah nigga I don't know, I don't know who got you
I don't know who stabbed you, I don't know who shot you
I don't know who cut you, I don't know who robbed you
But you think I know cause you know how my squad do
Aiyyo, that's my word on the stack of bibles
I don't know who did it I don't know who responsible
All I know who spittin all I know who givin
Me all this cash, just to put down twelve to get in yo' ass
Listen, keep it far away from me
I ain't got time for sittin in the penitentuary
All I know is I'm rich, all I know is that G-Unit work
When theb album drop they go bezerk
Mad video play, crazy radio spins
Number one all the time, our reign never ends
Don't point the finger at us somebody's hangin
They had a beef with us, plus we don't know nathin
Nah nigga I don't know, I don't know who got you
I don't know who stabbed you, I don't know who shot you
I don't know who cut you, I don't know who robbed you
But you think I know cause you know how my squad do
I don't know nothin 'bout jumpin out splittin homeboy head
But for real that's fucked up they say that homeboy dead
I can't even think, who 'gon want him dead
Have no idea what type of gun they done him with
You see I hear no evil and I see no evil
Ain't tryin to talk to or hear from or see those people
And I ain't had them little homies burn up no regal
I've been tryin to do this music thang and just go legal
I don't know why my name in your female's phone
But you really startin to sound like a females homes
Don't know why they told you that we sell stones
We on the internet tryin to get our Email on
Nah nigga I don't know, I don't know who got you

I don't know who cut you, I don't know who robbed you
But you think I know cause you know how my squad do
Nah nigga I don't know who sent them young boys through
To air the strip, shit just be happenin out the blue
I don't be around here, I ain't hip to the news
I don't know why that man clutchin on that shit when you move
I don't know why that other rapper got stripped for his jewels
You know how easy it is to get shit confused
I wasn't even in New York, I was just in the cruise
Somewhere way out in the islands woth your bitch in the cruise
Who's my bitch in the cruise, dudes get hit when they snooze
Lose they hit from the Uz, Uz all over the street

He talk about me all day but I ain't losin no sleep
Nah nigga I don't know, I don't know who got you

I don't know who cut you, I don't know who robbed you
But you think I know cause you know how my squad do
I don't know why my charm 'bout as big as your palm
And why the diamond chain I wear as 'bout as long as your arm
You tell me, how many diamonds in my bezel
There's one for everytime I had to grind up in the ghetto
I could show you how to do it, you tired of ridin Buicks
I don't know why niggaz rap for years and can't make hotter music
Even when, I don't do it chicks release body fluid
Body drop, shotty pop, and niggaz wanna tie me to it
I don't know why Loon and Fabby won't just say I'm they daddy
Why they solve them CB4 niggaz just keep comin at me
Got as many beefs as 50 and a nigga go to church
Could you imagine if my hands was on work, I don't know
Nah nigga I don't know, I don't know who got you
I don't know who stabbed you, I don't know who shot you
I don't know who cut you, I don't know who robbed you
But you think I know cause you know how my squad do
Yeah! It's my tape man, listen to my tape

I'm no fool I know money can't buy me love
But I'm a different type of nigga that make sure that you know
Instead of a rose, there's a hundred dozen of those
See I see somethin special when I look in your eyes
With your legs way back I see this pussy is mine
If you ain't sure when I'm talkin I don't tell you no lies

If I was your best friend
While you in your bubble bath I'll come wash on your back
When you puttin on your lotion I can help you with that
I sit and think of things to say that may make you smile
Or give you gifts from my heart to reflect my style
Or slang I use when we build may change how you talk
And if I'm focused while I'm strokin I could change how you walk
There's a swagger that you calm but when you come from New York
I'm a hustler I just hustle in the things that I bought
Separate me from the rest, I feel like I'm the best
If there's a price to pay for feelin you I pay that twice
I'm as ghetto as it gets girl you know that's right
I ain't got nothin to hide baby I tell you my secrets
'Fore you end up bein 'round long enough to peep shit
I get closer to you, I mean closer than close
I get into you, after I take off my clothes
Girl I been into you, mentally long before
If I was your best friend, I want you 'round all the time (I want you 'round me all the time)

I'm the teflon don boy I get busy
Ur legs to strong doing sex with pretty Ricky
760 drive by light tint
With two hoes in the whip looking like flip
The business is entertainment
And what entertain the customers is the sight of blood
Cam, I mean, I was bein' nice to him, okay, I'll get him
You *** should worship the ground I walk on
I make mills off the tracks I talk on, it's kingpin
50, don't call me, ***, I don't wanna talk it out
The *** will hit your leg, go on and walk it out
I see it clear, you tryin' to sabotage Jimmy
See what happens when you talk after sippin' the Henny?
I'll send Haitian *** at you, yeah, sak pase
Zoe pound ***, they don't play
Buck *** *** on camera and it's okay
'Cause my money make my lawyers make the *** go away
Attempted ***, get a year on probation
Cam, are you clear what you facin'?
You must ain't hear me, I done told you, I'm a boss
I'm eatin' good but I ain't chubby like Ricky Ross
Word on the street is that 50's not Jay
And Cam better stay out of his way
Everything's cooler than a fan till you rolled on
Have you in the I.C.U., tryin' to hold on
*** in the waitin' room, been waitin' so long
Till they hear the flat line, the doc say, he's gone, he's gone
That's *** up
When they say he's gone
He dead
Well, he knew that could happen, *** with the kid
This is graveyard music right here, ya dig?
This is not competition, this is ***
Career endin', mind bendin', Southside, ya finished
Now look, *** laughin' at Cam, down on Lennox
They heard what he did but they don't know why he did it
I have eighty of them boys with black flags
Come through with black ***
And have you *** zipped up in black bags
For a second he was hot, now he cold
I apply pressure on *** until they fold
But never mind me, man, that's just how I be
The game got me trained, they call me the hustle man
And like fame, my style will live forever
They thought I crossover 'cause they don't know no better
I think they think I'm laxed now 'cause I got the cheddar
Till I return back ***, trust me, it's nothin'
Everything's cooler than a fan till you rolled on
Have you in the I.C.U., tryin' to hold on
*** in the waitin' room, been waitin' so long
Till they hear the flat line, the doc say, he's gone, he's gone
When they say he's gone
It shouldn't have to be like this, man
Dipset, Cam, stay up, I'm not gonna destroy Dipset
Just gotta make changes, from now on, Jimmy's the boss of Dipset
And Juelz is the capo, he's gone
Cam's demoted to soldier, we like Jimmy better anyway

yea, they aint on the top of the charts
they don't know the formula, they aint on the hot 500,
They like me!

Oh, don't even look at me wrong
When I come through the hood
Ain't nothin' changed, still holla at my homies
Oh, and when I hit the block, I still will kill
And I don't want, nigga, but I will
If I got to kill
If niggas get to fuckin' around
If niggas get to fuckin' around
Respect come from admiration and fear
You can admire me if you can catch one in your wig
You see the Testarossa, the toaster's right on my lap
So if a nigga get out of line, a nigga get clapped
I got an arsenal, a infantry, I'm built for this mentally
That's why I'm the general, I do what they pretend to do
Front on me now, nigga, I'll be the end of you
Forget ya enemies and think of what'cha friends'll do
I drop a bag off, then let a mag off
The Heckler & Koch'll tear half of your ass off
I'm not for the games, I'm not for all the playin'
The hollow tips rain when I unleash the pain
Get the message from the lions or get the message from the nine
Paint a picture wit' words, you can see when I shine
Put my back on the wall, nigga, watch me go for mine
I let twenty-one shots off at the same time, yeah
Oh, don't even look at me wrong
When I come through the hood
Ain't nothin' changed, still holla at my homies
Oh, and when I hit the block, I still will kill
And I don't want, nigga, but I will
If I got to kill
If niggas get to fuckin' around
If niggas get to fuckin' around
Where I'm from death is always in the air homie
Nanna love me so you know she say my prayers for me
I come creepin' through the hood wearin' Teflon
Hit the corners motherfuckers get left on
Niggas know, if not, they better check my background
Try and stick me, I fill ya back wit' mac rounds
Ask 'Preme nigga, 50 don't back down
I keep it funky like fiends in a crack house
Cross the line, boy, I'mma air your ass out
Screw ya face at me, I wan' know what that's 'bout
Nigga, I know you ain't mad, I done came up
And if you are, fuck you 'cause I ain't change up
The O.G.'s wanna talk but I don't know these niggas
And I ain't did no business wit' em, I don't owe these niggas
A minute of my time, I get it 'cause I grind
All across the globe like the world's mine, yeah
Oh, don't even look at me wrong
When I come through the hood
Ain't nothin' changed, still holla at my homies
Oh, and when I hit the block, I still will kill
And I don't want, nigga, but I will
If I got to kill
If niggas get to fuckin' around
If niggas get to fuckin' around
Konvict
Now tell me have you ever looked up at an instance
And seen a mac aimin' at'cha head, mayne?
Before you know what life is flashin' and reminiscin
Your body is drippin' and full of lead, mayne
I done been there, I done cocked that
It ain't never been a question, I'm 'bout that
Don't go there, you can cock that
And if you plan to fuck around then reroute that
Youll never catch me ridin' around on these streets
Without a couple metal pieces under my feet
Fully automatic weapons and loaded wit' dumb-d's
Stashed up under the carpet like a can of Seabreeze
50 don't make me ride on these niggas
'Cause I will kill, dip and hide on these niggas
50 don't make me ride on these niggas
'Cause I'll be long gone like the Ripper
So don't even look at me wrong
When I come through the hood
Ain't nothin' changed, still holla at my homies
Oh, and when I hit the block, I still will kill
And I don't want, nigga, but I will
If I got to kill
If niggas get to fuckin' around
If niggas get to fuckin' around

Been smokin' that dip, the P.C.P. got 'em thinkin' they can walk on water
That ecstasy will have a nigga rock hard tryna fuck your daughter
The L.S.D. will have niggas runnin' round tryna kill you for us
Smokin' that piff, sippin' that yak, talkin' that shit, loadin' that strap

You know you want me, you probably want to lick this
Girl I'm a treat, everyday you can't get this

But we can get our freak on on some quick shit

In the precinct they saying I done murdered homey
I told my lawyer I ain't heard of homey
And everybody know my niggas buried him fo' me
You see I'm on your crib it ain't a burglary homey
They fin' to have me stuck in purgatory

Conventional methods of sex, totally bore me

Any motherfucker touch me, I'll murder them
I'll murder them
You don't believe me wait and see, I'll murder them
You see I told you I'd murder them
They saying I'm an accident waiting to happen
I got one in the head, I'm just waiting to clap it
A pimp told me I was made for this mack shit
So just get you a white girl, don't fuck with no black bitch
I got two felonies, from selling that crack shit
And the third one, came from showing niggas my mac spit
See I'm down for that daytime action
Have niggas crawling under cars when I start to capping
So they don't know what to say to the...
But they know if word get back, something gon' happen
I've been shot, I've been stabbed, but I ain't been snitched on
When you snitching where I'm from you gon' get your shit blown

Look miss, get a grip and let a motherf***er be
I'm a rap star who wants to be ridin' around in that car
Two in the front and the back got the plasma
This ain't a free ride you gotta have the g** ma

And I'm busy so I move a bit faster
You can't tell me yes if I don't ask ya

Damn near showin' his hand over the plastic
'Cause they wanna see your man go in the casket
Rule number one, keep your g** and get your a** hit, that's it

Ooh, when ya get 'em, they don't know you with me
They probably think the bouncers at the front door frisk me
This regular s***, the everyday mentality
They charged up, don't make me put in the battery

Corporate acquisitions, accumulations of wealth
Build with the gods and double knowledge of self
Entrepreneur visions, Moulin Rouge religion
That pussy make a weak nigga break down
So what you want, the cheese or the chicks'
You want the chicks but you want the cheese
A bitch gotta eat

You a bum nigga with a bum bitch
Your shoes come from Vegas
Counterfeit, fraudulent fakers
What kind of rich nigga bitch look like that
You all know when we pullin' off the lot
Brake, hit the button, then we pullin' down the top

Strapped with the glock, won't pull it out a lot

Y'all don't do it how we do
Niggas ain't on the shit we on
Everything new
Spikes on the Louis Vuittons
We up, nigga!
Visualize everything I needed and dream (uh-huh)
Penalized every ho nigga that have a scheme (what else?)
Guns in your video get you locked in a bing
Yeah, I kill a nigga quick, no worries, my record clean
Murder one become manslaughter as soon as they brought up
Charity work, parking tickets and no charges
Fuck nigga you fucked over your father when he gave you a dick
Should have been a bitch in pajamas
I made my first million fucking dollars
Bought a Bible, oh yeah, God got me
Made my second million dollars, bought a chopper and a binocular
I'm scared, this shit don't happen to everybody
I'm on Instagram looking at your favorite singer
Debating on should I fuck her or jump on her single
20 thou, she got a hell of a adlib
I'm in her mouth like I knew I could have kids, K-Dot
You all know when we pullin' off the lot
Brake, hit the button, then we pullin' down the top
Shine's on stuntin' and I'm pullin' out a knot

Spikes on the Louis Vuittons
We up, nigga!
Good pussy for dinner, bomb kush for breakfast
Deep-colored VS stones around my neck bitch
It feels like a nigga dreamin'
Seat back, music bumpin', niggas leanin'
Bulls eye, that's what we came for
The bread, now a nigga run the game boy
I should've sent the broad to report what's in the yard
Aloof livin', I came up so hard
No pain, no gain, it's embedded in the brain
I'm in it for the grip, motherfuck the fame
You all know when we pullin' off the lot
Brake, hit the button, then we pullin' down the top
Shine's on stuntin' and I'm pullin' out a knot
Strapped with the glock, won't pull it out a lot

I had a five hundred bags 14 grams of powder
On the phone with my connect should last about an hour
I need work, I repeat, I need work.
My niggas go bizzurk, when the drought come get murked'
When no money coming in is when the guns come out
Why the d's wanna sit in front of my momma house,
You know it's sort of like some shit you seen in a flick
Black nine extended clip as long as my dick

Motherfuckers freeze up when I come through
Mac 10 32 shot clip in my snorkel
I might smile and say whats up
But I don't fuck with you niggas
My rap money slow up
I run up on you niggas
I'm on the edge
I'm just waiting on a nigga to push me
Put my hand on my strap
What you looking at pussy?
We ain't buddy's, we ain't partners, and we damn sure ain't friends
Some much chrome on my Benz you see ya face in my rims
If your bitch wanna roll, I'ma let her get in
I don't play, but I'm a player til the motherfucking end

I got no pick up lines
I stay on the grind
I tell the hoes all the time
Bitch get in my car (get in)
Got my 64, riding on Dayton spokes
And when I open that door
Bitch get in my car
Don't tell me you don't know that

Man you better watch your girl, man
I leave with your bitch
I ain't standing these hoes, man I'm about my paper
If your bitch really bout it, nigga I'm gon' take her
Back seat of my jeep
Fuck til I fuck up her makeup
Take her to the Diamond District, introduce her to Jacob
Tell her if she like me, she should keep me icy
My game fuck with a bitch brain till she think she wifey
Spend her life savings in a day cause she likes me
Commitment for me?
Ah,nah, not likely
When I with Vivica
I Thought I was onto something
But then the next week, nah man it was nothing

Look into the windows of my soul
The eyes never lie
They bloodshot red
Its ganja in my system I'm high
First its pain when you lust for my love
Then it's smooth and calm
Feel the rush like the needles in your arm
It's a cold world baby girl
Loving me is not enough
Find out when you fucking broke
Love won't get you on the bus
Man you should see the pretty bitches that be sexing me
They suck cock to make em hot
I just let em stand next to me
Hundred percent thug
Freak too I'll taste your love
69's the position
Your mouth's full baby huh?

Turning over and I'm in your bed

You know ya wanna ride wit a nigga
50 Cent
G-G-G-G-G-G Unit
Coming up I was confused, my mommy kissing a girl
Confusion occurs coming up in the cold world
Daddy ain't around, probably out committing felonies
My favorite rapper used to sing, "Check check out My Melody"
I wanna live good, so shit I sell dope
For a four finger ring, one of them gold ropes
Nana told me if I passed I'd get a sheepskin coat
If I can move a few packs I'd get the hat, now that'd be dope
Tossed and turned in my sleep that night
Woke up the next mornin, niggas had stole my bike
Different day, same shit, ain't nothing good in the hood
I'd run away from this bitch and never come back if I could
Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine homey until my heart stop
(Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's M.V.P
And I ain't going nowhere, so you can get to know me)
Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine homey until my heart stop

 On the grill of my lowrider
Guns on both sides, right above the gold wires
I'll fo'-five 'em, kill a nigga on my song
And really do it, that's the true meaning of a ghostwriter
Ten G's 'll take your daughter out of Air Forces
Believe you me homey, I know all about losses
I'm from Compton, wear the wrong colors, be cautious
One phone call'll have your body dumped in Marcy
I stay strapped like car seats, been banging
Since my lil' nigga Rob got killed for his Barkleys
That's ten years, I told Pooh in ninety-five
I'll kill you if you try me for my Air Max 95's
Told Banks when I met him I'mma ride
And if I gotta die, I'd rather homicide
I ain't have 50 cent when my grandmama died
Now I'm going back to Cali with my Jacob on
See how time fly?
Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine homey until my heart stop
(Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's M.V.P
And I ain't going nowhere, so you can get to know me)

And I ain't going nowhere, so you can get to know me)
From the beginning to the end, losers lose
Winners win this is real we ain't got to pretend
The cold world that we in, is full of pressure and pain
Enough of me nigga now listen to Game
Used to see Five-O, throw the crack by the bench
Now I'm fuckin' with 5-0, it's all starting to make sense
My moms happy, she ain't gotta pay the rent
And she got a red bow on that brand new Benz
Waiting on Sha Money to land, sitting in the Range
Thinking how they spent 30 million dollars on airplanes
When there's kids starving
Pac is gone and Brenda still throwing babies in the garbage
I wanna know "What's Going On" like I hear Marvin
No schoolbooks, they used that wood to build coffins
Whenever I'm in the booth and I get exhausted
I think what if Marie Baker got that abortion?
I love you ma
Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine homey until my heart stop
(Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's M.V.P
And I ain't going nowhere, so you can get to know me)
Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine homey until my heart stop
(Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's M.V.P
And I ain't going nowhere, so you can get to know me)
Yeah
It is what it is man
Sirens flashin', you know the routine, the crime scene taped off
It started out a robbery, they blew half his face off
They seen him shinin', course full of diamonds he bought
Grindin', his foot slipped off the ladder of success he was climbin'
The D's came through, asked the niggas if they knew what happened
Somehow my name end up in anything that involves clappin'
Detectives at my mama crib, they say they wanna question me
They put me in a line up last time and they arrested me
When it come to cookin' coke, they know I got the recipe
I turn a quarter to a half, that's why they mess with me
I'm the neighborhood pusher, I move packs to make stacks
A little weed, a little X, a little H, a little crack
Figure, I push it to the limit, take this shit to the max
Navy blue vest on, navy blue Yankee hat
Calm, in my palm, fully loaded fire arm
First to let off, last to run, every time its on
I tell niggas to suck my dick
Get the fuck out my face 'cause I don't need 'em
'Cause they're never around when I'm down
Shot and I'm bleedin'
What, niggas yeah
Is there a mothafuckin' problem nigga
Oh yeah that's what I thought so, pussy
Niggas be talkin' about me, they always callin' me crazy
Fuck them O.G. niggas, they stuck in the eighties
Sayin' they gonna do me somethin', now you know that's a lie
Nigga you look at me wrong, I'll let that hammer fly
I'm rich, I still wake up with crime on my mind
Queens nigga put it down like Pappy Mason in his prime
When I say move, nigga move or get caught in the cross fire
Up a fence runnin', cut my fuckin' hand on a barb wire
Shits crazy, just a different day, its the same shit
Hollow tip part in ya head, leave ya whole fuckin' brain split
They sit, they see me in the Ashton Martin
What's the matter, they can't get that hoopty started
Thought they was grindin', well goddamn where that money at
Thought you was fucked, 'cause you was lettin' paper stack
You ain't a hustler, matter of fact, yous a busta
I don't trust ya, I should a sent niggas to touch ya
I tell niggas to suck my dick
Get the fuck out my face 'cause I don't need 'em
'Cause they're never around when I'm down
Shot and I'm bleedin'
What?
Who said they gonna do somethin' to me
You must be out your rabid ass mind
Fuck around and kill one of these niggas

God gave me style
God gave me grace
God gave me style
God gave me grace
God put a smile on my face
God put this smile on my face
God made me shine like the sun
God make me shine like the sun
Sometimes I feel like I'm the one
Sometimes I feel like I'm the one
It ain't my fault
I just reach for style, I'm hot I breaks it down
It ain't my fault, you can't break it down the way I break it down
Listen you can call me what you want, black and ugly
But you can't convince me the Lord don't love me
When my cds drop, they sell the best
You call it luck, why can't it just be I'm blessed
I'm a trackstar, runnin' through life, chasin' my dream
? I may even trade in a mic in for a triple beam
I zone off thinkin' is there really heaven or hell
So what happens to a changed man who dies in a cell
I need no answers to these questions, 'cause time will tell
Got a date with destiny, she's more than a girl
Don't much good come from me, but my music
Is a gift given from God so I'ma use it (Yeah!)

I just reach for style, I'm hot I breaks it down
It ain't my fault, you can't break it down the way I break it down
Some days, I'm in the crowd all by myself
Bunch of niggas around I'm still by myself
I'm drink off in the crowd, by myself
Thinkin' bout nothin' more than life, what else
These days its hard to tell who really cares for me
So you when hear this song, you should say a prayer for me
I put a message in my music, hope it brightens your day
If times are hard, when you hear it, know you'll be okay
A O.G. told me God's favorites have a hard time
You out the hood, that's good now stay on the grind
I'm a spunge, knowledge and wisdom, my ? off fast
I'm in a class by myself, you do the math

Yeah
Uh-huh
So seductive
I'll take you to the candy shop
I'll let you lick the lollipop
Go 'head girl don't you stop
Keep going 'til you hit the spot, whoa
I'll take you to the candy shop (yeah)
Boy, one taste of what I got (uh-huh)
I'll have you spending all you got (come on)
Keep going 'til you hit the spot, whoa
You could have it your way, how do you want it?
You gon' back that thing up, or should I push up on it?
Temperature rising, okay, let's go to the next level
Dance floor jam-packed, hot as a tea kettle
I break it down for you now, baby it's simple
If you be a nympho, I'll be a nympho
In the hotel, or in the back of the rental
On the beach or in the park, it's whatever you into
Got the magic stick, I'm the love doctor
I ain't finished teaching you 'bout how sprung I got ya
Wanna show me how you work it baby? No problem, get on top
Then get your bounce around, like a little rider
I'm seasoned vet when it come to this shit
After you work up a sweat you can play with this stick
I'm trying to explain, baby, the best way I can
I melt in your mouth girl, not in your hands, ha-ha
I'll take you to the candy shop
I'll let you lick the lollypop
Go 'head girl don't you stop
Keep going 'til you hit the spot, whoa
I'll take you to the candy shop
Boy one taste of what I got
I'll have you spending all you got
Keep going 'til you hit the spot, whoa
Girl what we do, what we do
And where we do, and where we do
The things we do, things we do
Are just between me and you, yeah, oh yeah
Give it to me baby, nice and slow
Climb on the top, ride like you in a rodeo
You ain't never heard a sound like this before
'Cause I ain't never put it down like this
As soon as I come through the door, she get to pulling on my zipper
It's like it's a race who could get undressed quicker
Isn't it ironic how erotic it is to watch 'em in thongs?
Had me thinking 'bout that ass after I'm gone
I touch the right spot at the right time
Lights on, or lights off, she like it from behind
So seductive you should see the way she whine
Her hips in slow mo' on the floor when we grind
Long as she ain't stopping, homie I ain't stopping
Dripping wet with sweat, man it's on and popping
All my champagne campaign, bottle after bottle, it's on
And we gon' sip 'til every bubble in every bottle is gone
I'll take you to the candy shop
I'll let you lick the lollipop
Go 'head girl don't you stop
Keep going 'til you hit the spot, whoa
I'll take you to the candy shop
Boy, one taste of what I got
I'll have you spending all you got
Keep going 'til you hit the spot, whoa
I'll take you to the candy shop
I'll let you lick the lollypop
Go 'head girl don't you stop
Keep going 'til you hit the spot, whoa
I'll take you to the candy shop
Boy, one taste of what I got
I'll have you spending all you got
Keep going 'til you hit the spot, whoa
This is 50
I don't know what you take me for
I really don't play that shit
I ain't got to get you hit
I get out myself and spray that shit
I got a itchy itchy trigger finger, nigga its a killa in me not to spray that shit
I got enough ammo shots to blow I up a hole in every motherfucker out this bitch
I unload then reload, when you get hit I supposed you goin' be strong enough to take this shit
I'm in the hood ridin' round with a chrome fo' pound, can you see through the windows see tints
I do dirt, the gat bussa, get to kickin' up dust, 'fore the jakes come around here kid
Niggas get knocked if they start askin' question, my name end up in all types of shit
I be a gangsta, a nigga till I die for sure, whether I'm poor or I'm filthy rich
Now what you know about movin' that Peruvian and flake for that cake, I get rid of them bricks
I don't know what you take me for
I really don't play that shit
I ain't got to get you hit
I get out myself and spray that shit
I don't know what you take me for
I really don't play that shit
I ain't got to get you hit
I get out myself and spray that shit
Man I gotta have shoes, you know chrome 22's, every time I get a brand new whip
I rolled around in a 5, till my money got right, then I went back and got that six
I'm in a big white Benz, on a hot sunny day, I call up the milk truck and shit
I have ya hoe, eye ballin' at the light, damn pimpin', you should take time to check that bitch
You saw me riding through the hood, actin' like its all good, but I'm lookin' for a ? and shit
In the middle of the night, you can turn on ya lights, I mean my niggas in ya crib
Nigga holla if there's a problem, and your niggas got drama, I got burners for sell and shit
Got the macs, got the nines, got them tecks all the time, holo-tips and the extra clips
I don't know what you take me for
I really don't play that shit
I ain't got to get you hit
I get out myself and spray that shit
I don't know what you take me for
I really don't play that shit

Man I'm tired of tellin' niggas over and over everything about me be gangsta
Man I'm tired of tellin' niggas over and over I won't hesitate to pop or shank ya
Man I'm tired of tellin' niggas over and over they can hustle and I'm in your shit
Man I'm tired of tellin' niggas over and over you don't listen you goin' get ya ass hit
This is 50
Yeah
Nigga cherish me
Like the water you drink
Like the air you breathe
You need me to live
Yeah
I told niggas not to shoot dice with me
Look at this stack

Nigga don't trip
I'll kill ya if you fuck with my grip
I won't hesitate to let off a clip
Nigga don't trip
You gon' make me get on some shit
Run up on you quick
What up, you're whipped
Nigga don't trip
You gon' get ya monkey ass hit
Run in ya lip tryna fuck with my clique
Nigga don't trip
Case you didn't know who this is
Its 50 Cent bitch, G-Unit
Nigga don't trip
I come through your hood, stuntin' in my yellow lam murcielago, top down, nigga damn
I'm the biggest crook from New York since son of Sam
Cruisin', bumpin' Bugz shit, rueger in my hand
Thinkin' the east ain't enough, its time to expand
I plan to head out west and plant my feet down
A nigga big as King Kong in the street now
I do a lil house shoppin', and buy me a crib
Its palm trees and pretty bitches out in Cali kid
I touched the Hollywood paper, go and shoot me some flicks
Have some supermodel bitches come and suck on my dick
My mom turn in her grave if I married a white chick
But becky'll suck the chrome off a Chevy and shit
Niggas be wearin' fake shines, I'm rockin' a lil charm
Thirty carrots on the pinky, kiss the ring on the Don
Crack open that Cali bud, stuff the weed in the bomb

Nigga you hustle, but me I hustle harder
I got what you need, them trees, that heart, that powder
My niggas we G packs, every hour on the hour
They shoot when I say shoot, so I'm in the position of power
You fuck around if you want to
Where I'm from, you learn to blend in, or get touched
I don't need niggas for support, I don't walk with a crutch
Niggas know my stage, they don't fuck with me son
You got an appetite for hollow-tips, I'll feed you my gun
This is that ferrari F-50 shit, its real laid back
Type shit you recline to in the Maybach
I got two shooters now, on the run from the fuzz
You get the same shit for ten bodies,as you get for one 'cause
I live life in the fast lane, 100 miles an hour, chrome and some wood grain
You know a nigga still really tryna move cane
Make a lil extra money on the side mayn
I ain't playin', I'm up early with the birds work
Puttin' that work in, pirrelli's on the Porsche chirpin'
I got a hundred mill from music, a hundred grand from crack
Goin' to see my jeweler, so I can blow a stacks

Niggas screw they face up at me
On some real shit son, they don't want beef
I cock that, aim that shit out the window
Spray, there ain't a shell left in my heat
Y'all niggas better lay down, yeah I mean stay down
Get hit with a K round, ya ass ain't gon' make it
You niggas goin' get laid out in blood and ya brains out
Have you on the concrete, shiverin' and shakin'
I'm from Southside motherfucker, where the gats explode
If you feel like you on fire, boy drop and roll
Niggas'll heat ya ass up cause they heart turns cold
Now you can be a victim or you can lock and load
The party jump, with shorty bouncin' that ass
I won't fuck, gimme a second, I'ma holla, I'ma see what's up
I got my razor in my hand, got my pistol in my trunk
Carve ya ass up nice, you play me like a punk

In my hood
Niggas got love for me, but I don't go no where without my strap
In my hood
A lil dro', a lil hennessy, a nigga just don't know how to act
In my hood
Niggas is grimey, I stay on point, I move with my gat
In my hood
Niggas might buck at me, so I keep somethin' around to buck back
In my hood
I don't trust a mothafuckin' soul when the D's come they fool
On my first case they told, where I'm from it ain't safe
To have more than a eighth, niggas'll come to your place
Put a gun in your face, tell ya open the safe
As your heart starts to race cause a robbery could turn into a homo-case
Co-opperate or Doc will have to op-porate, niggas will pop at you
Run the light, then pop at Jake, trust me son, niggas will go hard for that cake
These thirsty niggas will lurk, then you'll have to catch 'em and murk 'em
I'm observin' in my hood, these niggas be dumbin'
Shots go off at the dice game, all you see is 'em runnin'
They make it harder and harder to pump on the block
I'm a hustler, how the fuck I'm supposed to eat when its hot

That house party off the hook, until the shots go off
Well that's what you get for stuntin' on my block show off
You shit out of luck if niggas catch you slippin'
Crack money slow so you know niggas is trippin'
Shorty down there, on the Queens track takin' a whippin'
Shit, bitch get out a pocket, she needs some discipline
Peep the fiends, shootin' diesel in his arm in the alley
Look at the chrome spinners spinnin' on that black DeNali
The grimey niggas where I'm from, they want to see you chipped up
You shine, they gon' tilt you a block and shoot your whip up
It ain't good to do good in my hood
You know not to do good now


Summer, winter, spring, and fall
I'll be around to catch ya calls
Cause you're my baby (you're my baby)
And I adore you
You always brighten up my day
I never ever let you wait
Cause you're my baby (you're my baby)
And you're amazing (so amazing)

I'm from city to city to shop the show
See me I been glidin' across the globe
I hustle hard to get the grib fa sho'
So when I make time to call you, you should pick up the phone
Tell me, what's on your mind when you're alone
Have ya touchin' on yourself, girl all in the zone
Now if I told you all
What things I say would I be wrong
Well then I wouldn't be right
Matter fact I'd be on the next flight
Tryna get it on with you tonight
Do the things you like
Touch the right spot, have ya piped and hot
While the wind blow through your hair in the drop
Just lay back, relax to the sounds of the sex
And let me to what I do until you climax
You can go straight to sleep after its all over
In the mornin' roll over and we can start over


Yeah I called just to say hope you havin' a nice day
You're special, I get into you, oops I mean I'm into you
Every chance I get, I find time to spend with you
Jet to bring you to me, just to watch a movie
Better yet to watch you climb into the jacuzzi
Bubbles in the bath, don in the glass
Funny how time flies when you full of laughs
Its fun but before long, a nigga gotta dash
For the lifestyle I live, a nigga need cash
To come quick, so I don't fuck with the stash
I know you like pumps and boots
I like jeeps and coupes, so I grind all the time, just gimme some loot
I put a spell on you, I like to call it a spell
In the bedroom, workin' it well, I don't kiss and tell
But I don't care if you kiss and tell
You can tell your girlfriend the details
Man
You know where the niggas be at right?
Take me to 'em

All through the hood, I keep hearin' niggas sayin'
I'm supposed to die tonight (pup, pup, pup, pup, pup, pup)
Niggas come put a hit out and they talkin' like the shit okay

I'm down to ride tonight
We rollin, whip stolen, AK loaded
I'm down to ride tonight
Its smokin', street locin', locked and loaded
Somebody gon' die tonight
This is nothin' new, I been in the position before
Grandma crib, niggas outside of her door
Different day, same shit, old mac, new clip
Thirty two hollow tips, gloves, no rubber grip
I'm a boss, but niggas never show no respect
I catch 'em slippin', I have 'em tongue kissin' my tec
Want to come test me, pussy boy don't try
Police responds, never fast enough, the shots fired
Don't be stupid, find out who you fuckin' wit son
'Fore we find out where ya bitch gets her hair and nails done
Its elementary, life is but a dream
You know row, row ya boat, your blood forms a stream
After you get hit, you should of thought about the shit
You took that paper, you take a life or ya life get took bitch
Sometimes, I sit and look at life from a different angle
Don't know if I'm God's child or I'm Satan's angel

In 2002, if you asked me to make a wish
I simply would of wished that my music would be a hit
Big said damn, niggas want to stick me for my paper
And pray for my downfall, I understand it all
But me, I'm a little more flashy a nigga
So chances are, I'ma have to blast me a nigga
I'm on that teflon vest shit, that wild wild west shit
And eighty one 1 carrot stones in my necklace
I shine so hard, I make motherfuckers want to kill me
Every projects and every hood I go, they feel me
Know it sounds like rap, but this shit is real be
I don't talk that rich shit, but nigga I'm filthy
When I come out to play, had my mom been with me
You could bet your bottom dollar that revolver with me
Homeboy, frontin' on me will shorten your life span
Hold the mic with my left, the knife in my right hand

Yeah
Shady
Aftermath
G-Unit
Damn baby all I need is a lil bit
A lil bit of this, a lil bit of that
Get it crackin' in the club when you hear this shit
Drop it like its hot, get to workin' that back
Go shake that thang, yeah work that thang
Let me see it go up and down
Rotate that thang, I want to touch that thang
Can you make it go round and round
I step up in the club, I'm like who you with
G-Unit in the house, yeah that's my clique
Yeah I'm young, but a nigga from the old school
On the dance floor, a nigga doin' old moves
I don't give a fuck, I do what I wan' do
I hit your ass up, boy I done warned you
Better listen, when I talk, nigga don't trip
Yo' heat in the car, mine's in this bitch
I ain't tryna beef, I'm tryna get my drink on
Got my diamonds, my fitted, and my mink on
I'ma kick it at the bar till its time to go
Then I'ma get shorty here and I'ma let her know
All a nigga really need is a lil bit
Not a lot baby girl just a lil bit
We can head to the crib in a lil bit
I can show ya how I live in a lil bit
I want to unbutton your pants just a lil bit
Take 'em off or pull 'em down a lil bit
Get to kissin' and touchin' a lil bit
Get to lickin' and suckin'a lil bit
This is 50, comin' out your stereos
Hard to tell though, cause I switched the flow
Eyes a lil low, cause I twist the dro'
Pockets on swoll cause I move the O's
My neck, my wrist, my ears is froze
Come get ya bitch, she on me dog
She must of heard about the dough
Now captain come on and save a hoe
I get it crunk in the club, I'm off the chain
Number one on the chart, all the time man
When the kid in the house, I turn it out
Keep the dance floor packed, that's without a doubt
And shorty shake that thing like a pro man
She back it up on me I'm like oh man
I get close enough to her so I know she can hear
System thumpin', party jumpin', I said loud and clear
All a nigga really need is a lil bit
Not a lot baby girl just a lil bit
We can head to the crib in a lil bit
I can show ya how I live in a lil bit
I want to unbutton your pants just a lil bit
Take 'em off or pull 'em down a lil bit
Get to kissin' and touchin' a lil bit
Get to lickin' and suckin'a lil bit
Baby you got me feelin' right (ya heard me)
My mama gone, you can spend the night (ya heard me)
I ain't playin', I'ma tryna fuck tonight (ya heard me)
Clothes off, face down, ass up, c'mon
All a nigga really need is a lil bit
Not a lot baby girl just a lil bit
We can head to the crib in a lil bit
I can show ya how I live in a lil bit
I want to unbutton your pants just a lil bit
Take 'em off or pull 'em down a lil bit
Get to kissin' and touchin' a lil bit
Get to lickin' and suckin'a lil bit
All a nigga really need is a lil bit
Not a lot baby girl just a lil bit
We can head to the crib in a lil bit
I can show ya how I live in a lil bit
I want to unbutton your pants just a lil bit
Take 'em off or pull 'em down a lil bit
Get to kissin' and touchin' a lil bit
Get to lickin' and suckin'a lil bit
La la la la la la
Oh I'd lie for you baby
Oh I'd die for you baby
I build you up
But if ever I fall down
And I need you to pick me up
Promise me you'll be around
Hold me down
I'll build you up
Listen if you let me, I'll be the reason you shine
Its a secret I want the world to know that you're mine
But on some real shit, communications could be better
So I'm writin' a song, instead of a love letter
They can play it on the radio, a hundred times a day
I figure when you hear it, you would stop and think of me
I want to get to know ya and be the reason you smile
Girl, you know where I'm from, you know how I get down
When times are tough, tell me that I'm special
Not rap, I mean me, that I'm special
You know they say diamonds are a girl's best friend
Precious stones, could you put me before them
If so, I'll see to it that they always around
Nothin' but the best now, how does that sound
If I talk with you, when we talk you can keep it
Girl, you on my mind all the time, its a secret
Baby I'll build you up
Girl if I, never show I have you by my side
I build you up
Girl I need to know for sure you're mine
I need to know for sure
Baby I'll build you up
Girl if I, never show I have you by my side
I build you up
Girl I need to know for sure you're mine
I need to know for sure
I think about you thinkin' that you feel the same way
Was it just my imagination again runnin' away
If you ready to ride girl come on let's roll
G-55 fly ma let's go
Its hard to measure the pleasure of havin' you in my present
Your smile makes me smile, I'll show you my style
We can shop a lil' bit, I pick out my shit
One pair at a time, till your shoe games sick
Now who knows what the future holds, we'll be together probably
For better or worst, like Whitney and Bobby
If you want to play house, we can play house then
But wait why pretend if you can move in
Before I be your buddy in bed, let me be your best friend
Girl, its more than lust, I want your trust
You keep it real with me, I'll keep it real with you
'Cause I know with you by my side, there's nothin' I can't do
Baby I'll build you up
Girl if I, never show I have you by my side
I build you up
Girl I need to know for sure you're mine
I need to know for sure
Baby I'll build you up
Girl if I, never show I have you by my side
I build you up
Girl I need to know for sure you're mine
I need to know for sure
Yeah
Yeah we can ride to this
Just lay back, crew
Here's a taste of my life, its bitter and sweet
I put my heart out to the sounds of the drums and the beat
I put my life on the line when I'm out on the street
Put my Teflon on and roll with my heat
I keep my circle nice and small, I don't fuck with these clown niggas
In a race for the cheese, I run laps around niggas
Soon as I step on stage, the crowd applauds
Soon as my sneaker wear in stores, Reebok start sore
I ain't gotta say I'm a boss, niggas can tell
The east coast crib, the size of a small hotel
The shit journalist write about me, get me confused
Have me feelin' like the heavy weight champ when he lose
I read somewhere, I'm homophobic shit
Go through the hood, there's mad niggas on my dick
Now we can get hostile or we can do this smooth
T&T; around, I can still make blow move

This is what you call ryder music
All the gangstas are ridin' to it
Let's roll, I can show ya how we do it
When we ride to that ryder music (let's go)

Last year, I woke up, a good look, damn it feels good
On the low, I done fucked half of Hollywood
Had your favorite actress from your favorite shows
In my favorite position, you know how it goes
In my Bentley bumpin' Prince shit "This is When Thugs Cry"
This is what it sounds like when hollow tip slugs fly
Homie, this is somethin' you can ride and smoke to
Stay on point, cause niggas will ride and smoke you
Jealousy's for women, but some niggas is bitch made
They make you want to run across they're head with a switch blade
They point their finger at me, sayin' I'm bug
My flows crack you listen, your fuckin' brains on drugs
Look, ice drippin' on my neck, hands grippin' on the tec
Fool trippin' through the set, you can get ya ass whipped
Cards missin' out my deck, screws loose show respect
You try to come at me kid, your ass better come correct

My mama gave birth to a winner, I gotta win
Pray to Lord, forgive me for my sins
Still thuggin', cruisin', rims gleamin'
Like the stones on my wrist
Zonin', guess this is how it feels to be rich
Homie, you hustlin' backwards if you chasin' a bitch
Stupid, chase the paper, they come with the shit
I'm fallin', in love with success
Entrepreneur, kinda sewer, I maneuver the best
Rowin', ruger on my lap, rubber grip on the handle
Stunt I'll have ya homies burn a rest in peace candle
As wise men speak, I listen and learn
A man dies, a baby's born, my niggas the world turns
Rappers, I make 'em sick when I say I'm the shit
They mistake my confidence for arrogance, they hate on the kid
In '99, I had a vision and made a decision
Bein' broke is against my religion, now picked up


Y'all niggas know (what what y'all niggas know what I'm about)
Y'all niggas know, find me at my do' when the guns come out
I do this all the time, stuck with a little shine
Walk with a little nine, case I get in a bind
They say I'm fuckin' crazy, they think I'm out my mind
Cause I'm down to bust a nigga head all the time
Now you know the hoes, they know how I roll
In that new Rolls with the suicide doors
22 inch chrome, a nigga money low
You try to touch me, I put out ya get ya brains blown
You go against the grain, pussy and you on ya own
You right there in my zone, welcome to the terridome
The ice blowin' my chain, blood blow in my veins
Blue still in the range, I'm doin' my thang
The semi auto spray, run if you get away
I'll find your whereabouts and clap at you another day
Nigga play with the bread, get a hole in ya head
You touch a dime of mine thug and your ass dead

In the hood, hoopty, hate low, niggas don't know I'm around
Hop out, hit 'em up, lay my murder game down
You see me in ya projects, 187's in progress
Hard niggas finna' soften up when that lead touch 'em
You cut 'em once and keep fight, fuck it just keep cuttin' em
Its real killa instinct, kill or be killed
Trust me, you don't want to feel how hollow tips feel
Fuck around and get ya cap peeled
Nigga you know the drill, Brownsville
Flat bush, ground heights, Brooklyn Zoo
Feed the wolves, they eat the food
And they ? fathom too
Nigga welcome to the jungle, New York New York
Gangstas who signed ??? actually let their guns talk
I'm cool with some bloods, I'm cool with some cripes
I'm cool but if there's a problem, I got extra clips
I don't know karate, but I split the bricks
I don't love 'em loverboy, we the shit bitch

I'll come through and touch ya, walk out then cut ya
In case your dumbass want to tussle
Are-15, co-exist to make the shell case muffle
Scope, ? run you're still dead
Hit your calf, hit your ass, hit ya back, then your head
Contract killer, murder for the scrilla
Search, find a nigga, run up behind a nigga
Shoot car windows out to flat line a nigga
Gun pop, heart stop, homie this is heavy
You on your way to meet your maker, nigga are you ready
No exception to the rule, death is promised
Plus I just bought my niggas new macs and llamas
Got respect for you, ? I will accommodate you
One phone call and niggas will exterminate you
No future fuckin' with me, there's no tomorrow
Niggas'll run up on you tonight and hit ya the hardest

Yeah
Shady

I got a gatman
There's a problem I'ma solve it
A nigga movin' around
With a big ass revolver and a bat, man
What the fuck are you retarded
You touch Shady I'll leave you dearly departed
Robin, Cagney or Lacey, it's 50 cent and Shady
The worst baby, put your hands on my peoples
I'll react crazy, put a hole through ya front and ya back maybe
But dude if you try me, I'll have ya ass hooked up to an IV
I'll leave no witnesses when I ride, be
You fuck with me, you see
I'll react like an animal, I'll tear you apart
If the masterpiece was murder, I'd make shit art
Niggas knew I wasn't wrapped too tight from start
But bein' a little off, landed me on top of the charts
So you take the good with the bad, I guess
Level three Teflon plate on my chest
And my cock back hollow tip in the chamber
Will ain't ya, anger will change ya
And make ya aim there and squeeze
I got a gatman
There's a problem I'ma solve it
A nigga movin' around
With a big ass revolver and a bat, man
What the fuck are you retarded
You touch Shady I'll leave you dearly departed
Motherfucker, you retarded you touch 50
I'll leave you dearly departed
We're walkin' away from a beef, in which clearly you started
I said we're walkin' away, did you hear me you want to be thankful
That we ain't beefin' was to agree and just leave it at "that"
That's when me, 50, and G-Unit hop back in that "bat" mobile
It ain't gonna be no more rappin', it's gonna be "Reh!"
Retaliation will be like that Muslim shi'ite "attack"
Some where along the line, its like me and 50 made a "pact"
He's got my back, I got his back, "back"
It's almost like we're kinda like Siamese twins
Cause when we beef we pull each other in
So we'll do shit like we're conjoined at the hip
Its just unavoidable some of this shit is washable
And some shit will never boil up
And some of it will just simmer at best
If left at home, we'll let it be so there won't be no sit downs
The days that Zino, there will no peace discussions with me
There ain't gon' be no friendly debates over crumpets and tea
Just quit fuckin' with me and I'll gladly quit fuckin' with you
This bitch is sixteen and do what you gotta do to get through
Without mentionin' me you're gonna sing ? to Jimmy Iovine and Dre and 50
D-Twizzie, Obie and just let it be or we'll be back with a
I got a gatman
There's a problem I'ma solve it
A nigga movin' around
With a big ass revolver and a bat, man
What the fuck are you retarded
You touch Shady I'll leave you dearly departed
Nigga you get it twisted, you can get ya wig splitted
I don't give a fuck, I don't care if police know I did it
Man I hustle, I get money, in the sunshine or a blizzard
I go hard for that paper, homie I just gotta get it
Got a money scheme I'm plotting in the county and I'm with it
You cross me and you goin' make a cemetery visit
That's gangsta, you know me I told it, 'cause I live it
Showcases drop, when that chopper chop
Way up the block, get hit with copper tops
When drama pop, the llama pop
And it won't stop, you can run, call the cops
They say no, niggas know how I be on it
That shit you got, put my pistol to you I want it
Its not a game, perfect aim, you feel the flame
Up against ya brain, man its so hot I'll make ya wish it rained
I got a gatman
There's a problem I'ma solve it
A nigga movin' around
With a big ass revolver and a bat, man
What the fuck are you retarded
You touch Shady I'll leave you dearly departed
She loves me, she loves me not
Yeah she loves me not
The fiends need me, I ain't around it, bones ache
Detox, rehab, cold sweat, watch 'em shake
I'm not that genie in a bottle, I'm in a bag
Take one hit, I slide off to the land of the H man
When we first met, I thought you'd never doubt me
Now you trying to leave me, you'll never live without me
Girl, I'm missin' you, come and see me soon
Tie your arm up, put that lighter under that spoon
Now put that needle to ya arm princess, stick it in
Relapse you fat bitch, don't ever try that again
All that shit I did for you, I made you feel good
We have a love thing, you treatin' this like its just a fling
What we have is more sacred than a vow or a ring
You broke my heart, you dirty bitch I won't forget what you did
If you give birth, I'll already be in love with your kids
Listen, I don't give a damn if your ass start smokin'
But we have a bond and its not to be broken

We got a love thing where you try to leave me
But you need me, can't you see you're addicted to me
We got a love thing, I can take you higher girl
Fuckin' with me, you can be all you can be
Baby you know, on the low your sister be eyein' me
I'm good lookin', so you know, sure she be tryin' me
I heard she bisexual, she fuck with that girl
But boy, oh boy, fuckin' wit me is a whole 'nother world
After that first night, she fall in love, then chased a feelin'
I hung out with Marvin when he wrote "Sexual Healing"
Kurt Cobain even good friends, Ozzy Ozbourne too
I be with rock stars, see you lucky I'm fuckin' with you
I chill with Frankie Lyeman and Jimmy Hendrix crew
See this is new to you, but to me this ain't new
I live a lavished life, listen if the mood is right
Me, you, and your sister can do the do tonight
I never steer you wrong, you're hyper I make ya calm
I be the incentive and reason for you to move forward
Let's make a date, promise me you'll come and see me
Even if it means you have to sell ya mama's TV
I love you, love me back, no one said lovin' me'd be easy

I love you, I got you barefooted on glass, chasin' a dove
That monkey on your back, symbolizes my love
Your friends talk bad about me bitch, you sit there and listen to 'em
Over and over you hurt me, my love is unconditional
They talk to you when you up, you down they got nothin' to say
But when you call, I'll come runnin', I'll always take the pain away
They set you up, to let you down, they crowned you prom queen
Fiddle about me behind your back, they call you a fuckin' fiend
Can we just be alone, so I can kiss and hug you
Plus me beside you, no other man can loves you like I do
Call me daddy, I'll make you feel good, I mean real good
I found pleasure in pleasin' you, like a real man should
It was written long before, it was carved in a tree
Forever me and you baby we were meant to be
There's more to life than laughter, what brought us together was fate
And we'll be hand in hand, when you walk through those pearly gates
And to see to that, I'ma do whatever it takes

Looking through the window [x2]
You movin too fast, you movin too quick
You heavy on the gas, you movin too swift
Can't keep up the pace
Might not finish the race
But do it now for it's too late to switch
And how you make a impala lift
But the set car is ya heart
And is hard to be fixed
You gon break it if you don't downshift
And I know you get a rush
When you hang around risk
But gon get enough
When you breakin down sick
All I'll cant move your wheels
And feelin like shhh
Just a mile back you was fellin quite brisk
Now you sitting on bricks with your car on strict
Radio gone insuarance won't cover
Paint job wreck and you draggin your muffler
Wouldn't listen then, but I bet you hear now
Cos you got speed ticket
Cos you wouldn't slow down
Yeeeah!
Monster.
How should I feel?
Creatures lie here.
Looking through the window [x2]

lawyer so good, paid a fine for the body
heroin and B-more, crib by the seashore
car service to the G4 (?) valour
piff rolled in the dutch or the cuban cigar

I rock a nigga to sleep,
roc-roc-roc-a-bye baby
roc-roc-roc-a-bye baby

You should be dead by now
Smile but wait until my shooters come round
With the talids and hollow tip rounds
In my hood they know how I be down (when I say dead, you dead)


Nigga I show you my teeth all through the beef
Paint the sidewalk red with the back of your head
Shootouts in my hood like a daily routine
D's think Im involved with a nigga hit hard
So when I empty the shell and the hollow tips fly
Nigga You can cross your heart and hope not to die
Come through squash the drama send niggas with llamas
They'll eat your ass up fuck being masked up
I was given the gift of life
first Sabrinas since then Ive been jammed up
and fucked with the nina
Nana raised nine kids I turned out the meanest
I mean a menace
fuck with me and your finished

You should be dead by now
Smile but wait until my shooters come round
With the talids and hollow tip rounds
In my hood they know how I be down (when I say dead, you dead)


Homie I dont always pay my debts when I owe a nigga bullets
Got an arsenal of infiltry and niggas to pull it
Go head stay out on me, dump weight its nothing
I chase a nigga down, and touch him, catch him and buss him
Bitch get out the way, baby while I spray it
I wet a nigga like a hydrant on a hot summer day
But you can catch me in May riding down with the K
Better watch what you say, we get it popping today
Yeah me I make it hot round here, I call the shots round here
I have a nigga tearing off your top round here
This is a land of broken hearts, where bullets shatter dreams
And everything a nigga want is only triple beams
southside

You should be dead by now
Smile but wait until my shooters come round
With the talids and hollow tip rounds
In my hood they know how I be down (when I say dead, you dead)


roc-roc-roc-a-bye baby

Look at what they did to me, they burned me,
They turned me, into an animal, they flipped, Son they burned me,
To the first degree me,

I can't believe they burned me, I showed them love they showed me hate,

I got so many enemies, so many memories,
So many flashbacks, we used to be friends,
Sugar turned to shit, people just change,
They keep pushing a nigga to that hammer go BANG,
You violate, I will let that motherfucker rang,
Feels like, money came and more money came, and
Niggas start foaming out the mouth growin fangs,
Now, when did I become the savior of the hood,
Look homie, u don't know me, I wouldn't save you if I could,
I sacrifice for suckas and they change me, I'm angry
They selfish, all they want is what they want so they blame me, (WOW)
Like it's all my fault they ain't caked up,
You a grown ass man, Damn when you gon wake up,
Turn 7 to 14, 14 to 28, I owned a 62, Nigga get up your weight,
Learn how to dump the Jake, stack the paper then you straight.

I tried to help a nigga eat, Man it's hard out on the street,
Cuz I'm kind they think I'm weak (they burn me)
They see the way I grind, and they like the way I shine,
They want paper like mine (They burn me)
Man they be on some shit when they tryin to hit a lick,
Man a motherfucker flip, (So they burn me)
You think they won't trip cuz you helped them from the rip,
They ain't loyal to shit.

She called the cops on me cuz I don't love her like I used to,
Tried to fix what was wrong, Gets it hurts cuz I'm gone,
My son, he loves me but she tryin to poison his mind,
Actin like everything they got ain't come from my grind,
I said a prayer for her like, "God please change her heart,
All this hatred at one time is tearing me apart"
Man I ain't lookin for trouble, I'm lookin for blessings,
But ever since the money came, Me I've been stressing,
Got my ass kicked for being kind, I can't trust nobody,
The closer they get to me, the more they take from me,
Man, I'm givin all I got to give, I'm tryin to live,
They look at me, their eyes got dollar signs, they want the kid...
To give it all up, fall apart, break down, I ain't got much left, what they wanna take now,
My life, I got so much more to offer, I'ma make them watch me be number one till I'm done, YEAH

I tried to help a nigga eat, Man it's hard out on the street,
Cuz I'm kind they think I'm weak (they burn me)

Man they be on some shit when they tryin to hit a lick,
Man a motherfucker flip, (So they burn me)

New cat with a old school feel
Only new artist with a old school deal
Taught the game by Steve Lobel
So we always win, don't receive no help
New girls act like they know me so well
But I shows no love and be like "Oh, well"
When my album drops, sure as hell going to sell
Stack cash and laugh like LOL

While rather elbows in the hills of the high society
I look back on my life and realized the hood lied to me
Built the bullshit since the pride inside of me
On a rise to fly car hating on varieties

Look, I don't know no bitch nigga surrounding me
Record you better stick to the code that you provide to be
A kill play the 50th get your whole shit split
So call kingpins get real money to snitch

I know it sound hard to believe this bullshit
But sometimes you need money to see who you cool with
See niggas hustle hard and cop them a few whips
They end up popping niggas they used to be cool with

I'm a street entrepreneur, condo, cond sour
First way, my car's the core
Nigga I've been the boss I employed my boys
And show em a bunch of shit they never seen before

I got a business mind,
That block is mine, that brick and them glocks is mine
I got a business mind
That trap is mine, these knots and this watch is mine
I got a business mind

The button gets pressed see your life get destroyed
That niggas did a 30 shit just cause they bored
Man I ain't even gotta tell niggas what for

You think you true but I swatch your type of fly
Yeah you crossed... but you forgot your eyes
That's why I out charisma, out ...bizness you
In tender days you work success
I catch the interest of

Corporate America gangstas we got it tearing up
We only want the money, no reason to be scared of us
We feel it like what we live is unfair to us
America's an oven, you gotta break bread for us

Go hard or die soft is what was said to us
So if it's gunplay you're gonna get shot instead of us
Crackers be thinking they one step ahead of us
I say shit like that to let them know that I'm aware

We keep accountants to count
I got lawyers to share
...debate, clean up my mess
Go make the bed bitch
They said death or jail it's what's ahead of us
So when they ask me what I thought
All I could say is

I'm a street entrepreneur, condo, cond sour
First way, my car's the core
Nigga I've been the boss I employed my boys
And show em a bunch of shit they never seen before

Benz on chrome shoes, crib sitting on mad acres

I'm hood, I'm so hood, I'm ghetto like a motherfucker [x2]
I had a five hundred pack 14 grams of powder
On the phone with my connect should last about an hour...
I need work, I repeat, I need work.
My nigger's go bizzurk, when the drought come get murked'
When no money coming in is when the guns come out
Why the d's wanna sit in front of my momma house,
You know It's sort of like some shit you seen in a flick
Black nine extended clip as long as my dick
They say I'm grimmey, yeah fuck it I line niggers
I show them where your shit at before they take mine nigger
Don't take it personal, it's just how I grind nigger
Figure, this is a dog eat dog world, man
Ebony enemy today I'm tryin' duck I got that [?]
Her head'll make you kill a motherfucker (don't stop)
I mean you gotta feel it man
She bob and weave up and down you'd be like "I could just kill a man"
I don't fuck with them niggers from her projects
They're on section eight but niggers cars are straight
They ain't out in the day time them niggas's roaches
I don't stop down there if I ain't got the toasts'
I'm in the six four five hard top, not the drop
Leanin', I see them niggers schemin', dream on
Touch me, shitt I wish a nigga would
I'll have my niggas deep, I have them light up the whole hood.
I'm hood, I'm so hood, I'm ghetto like a motherfucker [x2]
They said I fell off, my benz was on the repo truck
Around the same time niggas spot start gettin' stuck
I say 'I ain't know none about nothing'
I'm on the low, niggers really know me for stuntin'
I pull through on low pros, wrapped around deep dishes
That crack money handsom, your bitch blowin' me kisses
You need to check her if you think she could be the Misses, damn
I'm starting think you can't trust nobody
I hold my own strap, they ain't gotta hold that for me
And slide by my baby momma crib with the mac homie'
My sister's cousin in a car crash died
She said 'don't drink and drive', I say 'just drink, don't drive'
I had a morphine dream I got heroine ambitions
I see money cooking in that coffee pot in the kitchen
When I say I'm straight, I mean I'm straight
Once the razor hit the plate I double up the cake (heyy)

Summer heat, hot, murder plots, niggas getting shot
Chrome rims for sixes
One will, one gypsy
Throw it up, one hand
Wave back at the bitches
I'm silent
Right before I snap I'm violent
I call myself the tussle
Boss in the muscle
Boy I feed your ass brass knuckles
A nigga come creeping through the four
You scared, get a dog
Get a male, because a bitch'll get you both in the mall
Now peep the punchlines I'm punching these are knockout blows
I'm cyber pimping I got sci-fi hoes
This is next-level mack shit
That's why my money stack quick
12 V's V12 half of them triple black bitch
Lust, gluttony, greed, jealousy envy me
Your blinds blurring your vision, see I'm where I'm supposed to be
On top of the underground
Still gritty
Still running cities
Still Em', Dre, and Fiddy
Fuck with me, I'm an usual suspect when it's a hit
Turn up the volume and hear my voice, yeah it's the shit

Pardon me please, may I speak to you (May can I speak to you)
Feel this is something (You know, I just do what I wanna do)
I'm compelled to do (Who gon' stop me, who gon' stop me, uh?)

Pistols and bad bitches
Hustlers and bad business
Rapping was just a hobby, that hobby turned to a million
Had that oxy on sale
You can get it 50 a pill
Sniff it or let it grill
Rap the foil you know the drill
Money, power, and drugs
My only reason to love
Never played cops and robbers, nigga we played
Crips and Bloods
Like to the pimps saying who the sluts?
211 on hookers purses
Another double up purchase
Slanging a hundred meters from churches
God forgive me, but the steal was worth it
Man I swear I needed some change,
chains and golden rings and thangs
Niggas watch videos and think them dudes
went from rags to hardest
For real lokes know that type of thing makes you a target
Either the pigs or I'm gonna get you while you playing boy
Hold you like an animal
Strapped with a bean that's Adam Braun
50 told me ambition wins when your talent ain't working
I say I'd rather relapse
Than reenact Curtis and put that work in

Pardon me please, may I speak to you (You see that?)
Feel this is something (That's what I'm talking about)
I'm compelled to do (I like that, nigga)

They cant keep a good man down
Always keep a smile when they want me to frown
Keep the vibes and I stood my grounds
They will never ever take my crown,
They will never ever take my crown,
They will never ever take my crown,
I'm still the shit I'm rich already
Fuck around will be reading your obituary
My whip clean, my watch gleam
9 karats hoe, thats what I call a pinky ring
Dont even trick, my heart cold
Im round the globe, Im all parole
I ball hard, I go hard
They say Im grimey, up to no good
Oh god
Shawty work that, when she twerk that
She a canna, she damn close to perfect
I'm like wont stunt, throw a hundred racks

But now I ride on some conscious shit
I'm getting bread while I toast to my accomplishments
Only one I could have a problem with is myself
That's probably why my only competition is myself

Or push the dough on the liquor store, see where it get ya
But me, I got to be on top
I said, me I get to be on top
I got the street on lock
I'm on automatic pilot, ain't nobody starting me
Growing up in poverty ain't fill my heart with larceny
Niggas ride, I don't hide, I dump to get 'em off of me
I'm a leader, look and see the natural born boss of me
They from Bel Air, I'm from the bottom
Soon as I spot 'em I get to drop 'em
I got 'em the competition, red-dot 'em
It's dinner time when the 9 come out
It's off with the chain, off with the ring
Move bang, off with ya brain
Party people say, party people say
Ay it's a new day, it's a new day
World is getting ready, everybody ready, yeah!
For a new day, for a new day, celebrate and say
Ay
Marks on the wall
It's now or never at all
I'm gonna give it my all
Whether I rise or fall
True story, I said I'd get rich or die trying
I did it, good luck sucker, trying to stop my shine
Nothing matters but the music, music my first love
We paper chasing, I'm always coming in first, cuz
I'm built for it, see I'm better under pressure
I react like a maniac when I'm coming to get ya
I got to win, Em watch and Dre watch and my son watching
Fuck that, losing ain't an option
I'm sharp I'm on point
The ink from my ballpoint
Throwing out my pain
I'm back on my A-game
I'm focused, for me this is just another victory
Except that I'm stronger than an ox now mentally
Party people say, party people say
Ay it's a new day, it's a new day
World is getting ready, everybody ready, yeah!
For a new day, for a new day, celebrate and say

I'm trying to move 5 bricks, 10 bricks, 20 bricks raw

Now I'm trying to move 5 pounds, 10 pounds, 20 pounds, more boy)
Run tell the blood's I'm crip and go tell the crips I'm blood
Nigga, I be tripping, bitch, I don't give a fuck
I put the K on niggas, I spray on niggas
Come through 2012, XJ on niggas
I'm a Apex predator, nigga, I'm strolling
Shooters on deck, I break bread and they own me
Niggas said I fell off, oh, you heard I fell off?
Why the fuck would you be repeating that?
Nigga, I'm rap tycoon, make a 100 mill by June
Now who the fuck said I can't rap, Jack?
I'm in a dolphins dream, I got it for 'em raw
That's that morphin memories, except I'm breaking the law
I was born a (?), in the stroller with the llama
I'm violent, I kill a nigga, put that on my mama
Nah, nah, don't tell me nothing about none of these niggas
I smoke all these niggas for this bread
I'm trying to move 1 one brick, 2 brick, 3 bricks, four, more
I'm trying to move 5 bricks, 10 bricks, 20 bricks raw
(I smoke one ounce staring at the caddy on the showroom floor
Now I'm trying to move 5 pounds, 10 pounds, 20 pounds, more boy)
I give a fuck about a fed as I jump up outta bed
5 pounds, 10 pounds, 20 pounds, yeah
I'm trying to put this shit away
On the low, I need a hit a day, think you better get away
From my, oh, my, I got a bernie that'll fire
From Cali to Kingston, back to NY
Snoop's master kush, smoke 9 to 5
Come by and get you some pounds and now you flying high
Rub it with the metal with my foot to the pedal
G's with the trees and (?) on my level
5-0, you know I go hard, these fools caught me bogart
Head nigga in charge, these nigga's soft as DeBarge
But I ain't tripping, I'm just flipping my cheese
Cause if you really want the bomb come and fuck with your G's

Had that, sit that, my nigga get that, you hear that?
I'm trying to move 1 one brick, 2 brick, 3 bricks, four, more
I'm trying to move 5 bricks, 10 bricks, 20 bricks raw
(I smoke one ounce staring at the caddy on the showroom floor
Now I'm trying to move 5 pounds, 10 pounds, 20 pounds, more boy)
5 AM in the kitchen, nigga, I'm coughing
Bag full of white 8 balls, I'm going golfing
Now homie got killed last night, bought him a coffin
Retaliated the same night, made him a dolphin
Guess that's the life of a yay flipper
Choppers making your ass get naked just like a stripper
Got cameras for the jackets, home invaders, man
Them niggas coming all black like they Raiders fans
All I saw growing up was kilos and gangbanging
Then the homie taught me to whip, game changing
Now I'm breaking down birds on the coffee table
Yeah, and half them bitches sold 'fore they off the table
Gotta lil nigga want him a half, I'm gonna split it
The type of nigga work that bitch like it's a skillet
Sold them more water, stretching like it's elastic
Weigh it up in 250's, wrap it up in plastic, yeah
I'm trying to move 1 one brick, 2 brick, 3 bricks, four, more
I'm trying to move 5 bricks, 10 bricks, 20 bricks raw

Now I'm trying to move 5 pounds, 10 pounds, 20 pounds, more boy)
My life, my life
Makes me wanna run away
There's no place to go
No place to go
All the confusion
It's an illusion like a movie
Got nowhere to go
Nowhere to run and hide
No matter how hard I try
Yeah, 03, I went from plain filthy to filthy rich
Man, the emotions change so I can never trust a bitch
I tried to help niggas get on, they turned around and spit
Right in my face, so Game and Buck, both can suck a dick
Now when you hear 'em it may sound like it's some other shit
'Cause I'm not writing anymore, they not making hits
I'm far from perfect, there's so many lessons I done learned
If money is evil look at all the evil I done earned
I'm doing what I'm supposed to, I'm a writer, I'm a fighter
Entrepreneur, fresh out the sewer, watch me maneuver
What's it to ya? The track I lace it, it's better than basic
This is my recovery, my comeback, kid
My life, my life
Makes me wanna run away
There's no place to go
No place to go
All the confusion
It's an illusion like a movie
Got nowhere to go
Nowhere to run and hide
No matter how hard I try
While you were sipping your own Kool-Aid getting your buzz heavy
I was in the fucking sheds sharpening my machete
Sipping on some of that revenge juice, getting my taste buds ready
To wolf down this spaghetti, or should I say this spaghett-even?
I think you fucking meatballs keep on just forgetting
Thought he was finished, motherfucker, it's only the buginning
He's buggin' again, he's straight thuggin', fuck who he's offending
He'll rip your vocal chords out and have them bitches plu~gged in the
Motherfucking wall with three thousand volts of electrucity
Now take the other end of 'em, then plug them motherfuckers in each
One of your eye sockets cause I thought you might finally fucking see
That'll teach you to go voicing your cocksuckin' opinion to me
I done put my blood, my sweat and my tears in this shit
Fuck letting up, you're gonna end up rugretting you ever betted against me
Feels like I'mma snap any minute, yeah, it's happening again
I'm thinking about just saying
"Mother fuck everybody that's up in this bitch, but 50!"
'Cause this is all I know, this is why so hard I go
I swear to God I put my heart and soul into this more than anybody knows
I'm trapped, so all I do is rap, but every time I rap I'm more trapped
And I rap myself right into this bubble, oh I guess it's bubble wrap
This is like a vicious cycle, my life's in a crisis
Christ, how was I supposed to know shit would turn up like it did?
Feels like I'm going psycho again
And I might just blow my lid
Shit, I almost wish that I would have never made Recovery, kid
'Cause I'm running in circles with
My life, my life
Makes me wanna run away
There's no place to go
No place to go
All the confusion
It's an illusion like a movie
Got nowhere to go
Nowhere to run and hide
No matter how hard I try
I haven't been this fucking confused since I was a kid
Sold like forty million records, people forgot what I did
Maybe this is for me, maybe
Maybe I'm supposed to go crazy
Maybe I'll do it three A.M. in the morning like Shady
Psycho killer, Michael Myers, I'm on fire like a lighter
Try to say this ain't classic, get your ass kicked mad quick
Wrap your head up in plastic, pussy
Now pick the casket, dirt nap with the maggots
It's tragic, it's sad it's
Never gonna end, now we number one again
With that frown on your face, and your heart full of hate
Accept it, respect it
This a gift, God-given, like the air in the lungs
Of every fucking thing livin'
My life, my life
Makes me wanna run away
There's no place to go
No place to go
All the confusion
It's an illusion like a movie
Got nowhere to go
Nowhere to run and hide
No matter how hard I try

When I'm OT on the grind going hard for mine
Yo when shorty say she hate me
You know she mean she love me
When she play me close at the bar
That mean she want some Bubbly
See my polying with another chick and shit get ugly
She want to flip threaten to run keys across my whip

That's how she on it
When I met her she was lowkey
Now she want to OD
You know me I let her do her thing son

Niggas say that I'm illing
I sip Cristy so I'm pissy
Like a staircase in your building

And my friends don't understand
How my baby laces me
A thug is what I want

And my friends don't understand
And I think its jealousy

I hate when you niggas do shit then make me ask why
If you the homie why you won't go and testify?
Why you wanna see a nigga get the chair and fry?
I'll grow old in the yard starin' at the sky
Why you hurt your friends more than your enemies?
And why you don't sit and stroll through your memories?
Why is the question I ask
Shit was all good when you were splittin' up stacks
That shit you told the people got 'em under max
Now why, would you wan' do some shit like THAT?
When that barrel on yo' forehead, don't ask why
Shhh, quiet, close your eyes and die!

Bitches I don't love no of 'em, the guns I'm running 'em
Punk niggas I'm sunning 'em, every chance I get
Man I know niggas is a trip, so I save all my grip
For these babies faggots flippin', dial 1-800-TIPS
Force me to bury the bricks, and the whips and take trips
Every word that come out of my mouth, I mean it, you could eat
'Cause when I stick you, you gon' cough it up like you bulimic

And I wanna be your happy pusher
Then pulled the beetle in the first place
Nowadays the Ali Key let me hold some
Look nigger cause I know you know

Type of nigger gonna get wild with no man
Ride a game thing, play the btch without the ball

Benz parking, rims glossing, click closing
Tell her way you drained the bottles
With the towels sparkling
Say money talks, nigger my shit...

Faggot ass niggas (50 Cent show these niggas how to rock)
Yo, they done shot that boy down like a dog in the street
Left him smelly, man fuck that, roll em over take that fellas pellet
You ain't never heard a motherfucker spit like this
Not even puff, and that nigga there made crazy hits
Every few years a nigga come who crazy hot
I'm the next best thing since Biggie and Pac
Now I'm sayin this shit slow, so you don't miss it
Don't be a statistic, my jewels from the district
Stay with my biscuit, touch mines and get twisted
Son I'm off the meter, my mind locked on crime
See I'm tired of all these rappin niggas dyin to shine
And I'm tired of fiends askin for a dime for nine
Hearing this next punch line from me, may sound strange
You sit your 5-dollar ass down, before I make change
Yo the sale went stale, caught em real bad
Fresh out the jail, shit is really real
Niggas is still in jail, and I pray they don't tell
20-man inditement, my lawyer gotta fight this
Niggas know, I ain't never pressed for dough
And niggas know, I don't serve nobody I don't know
Son said he was from O.T., pay 11 an o.z.
My man brought em to me, see he ain't really know b
That it was hot, dude was a cop
He was just tryin to pop, to put the new beams on his drop
First I served him o.z.'s, then I served him whole keys
Now we all co-de's, damn man I O.D.
You know how it is on the street, niggas is holdin the heat
Po-Po walking to beat, we burnin l's up in the jeep
Ain't nothing sweet, we used to move so strategic
It's over I can't believe it, damn it's over
Fed's ceased the six, the Lex' and the Range Rover
Now a nigga rollin in a Toyota Corolla
Used to never get high, now I'm never sober
380-6 shot glock top load-up
Keep it in my waist son, I'll put one in your face
I ain't got nothing to lose, nigga so stay in your place
Just jumped bail, I ain't been on the run long
But it feel like a mathafuckin' marathon

Uh huh, Uh huh, five, five, one... it's real shit nigga

You niggas say somethin' slick, you'll get SLAPPED for that
You niggas schemin' on some jewels, you'll get CLAPPED for that
If ya'll niggas want war, I got the MACK for that
Run up with some work, and get your head CRACKED for that

Nigga if a nickel bag sold in the park, I want in on it
The bullshit I'm in right now nigga, I've been on it (yeah)
If I don't eat, nobody eat, code of the street
No surrender, no retreat, my niggas rollin' with heat (woo)
You'll know my stees, I spark trees, under palm trees
Feel a breeze, and fees, in expanded keys
Cop it straight from the bay, tap dance on the yay
Your people make a G day, you ain't rich, you just ok
I take the stand under oath and lie
Before I snitch on my clique, I'll fry
Or watch time go by
Niggas want to steal slabs, and dib or dab
In the posse, who steals from the hands that feed 'em, deserve
to die
 - 2X

You gettin' money nigga (yeah), you dimed out (yeah)
Well 50 Cent is the hottest shit out this (yeah)
You bust your gun nigga (yeah), you on the run nigga (yeah)
You treat a grown man, like he ya son (nigga)
Yo, I ain't the first parolee, to catch his nigga for his rolee
And after being on the street, less than a week
Look, niggas who know me, know I'm up to no good
Man my fan base is spreading like HIV in the hood
Why smack a nigga silly, when I can squeeze the nilly (squeeze
that shit)
A slug'll split a niggas ass, worst than the philly
I stay with the heater, cut the D with Bonita
My wifey kept acting up, so I had to leave her
It hurted when I left, but I knew I didn't need her
If it wasn't for my seed, I wouldn't even hafta see her
She tried to front like she don't need me, she miss me, believe
me
It's that soap opera shit, the bitch watch too much TV
 - 2X

Aight you niggas tryin' to do too much (STOP FRONTIN')
Them little bit of chips you got son, (AIN'T NOTHIN')
I seen you with your whip outside (YOU STUNTIN')
You spent your last on that (YOU AIN'T HOLDIN' NOTHIN')
Rap niggas, they actin' like they ready to flip
When I let off a clip, it ain't a part of the script
Its like tradition, rap niggas, dyin' they whips
So I spent a little chips, to bulletproof my shit
You a 6 coupe nigga, but you gears behind
Nigga yours a 92, mine's a 99
Your not in my league, the ghetto taught me tools to succeed
Shallow up a seed, I'll write it down so you can read
If you've been listening, I know you've been loving what I said
If not you dumb f**k, I just run over your head

You punk ass n*gga

Oh I could fill your head up girl but I ain't gonna lie
I just wanna f*ck you girl

N*gga really wanna get to know you girl
So many things I wanna show you girl
Succeed then I guess I owe you girl
Louis Vuittons movin' on
For the sun comes up and the top comes down
Find out what the white Rolls Royce about
Why the white Air's on extra clean
Like James Brown a n*gga do it like a sex machine
Got a Hot Wheel fetish I pull up in some mean sh*t
Sex, drugs, rock'n'roll, Charlie Sheen b*tch
See me suited and booted on my Obama sh*t
Money ain't no telling how much I'ma get
I spit bars had the hood in a frenzy
F*ck around take a chain like Lindsay
Paparazzi taking pictures of my Fendi
Catch me in Prada or maybe Escada
It's just another beautiful day in LA
And I'm in New York, a professional sh*t talker
Uh huh, I see n*ggas is stressing
And I'm straight, so I'm guessing
I'm above the recession

I could take you to dinner girl but I ain't gonna lie
I just wanna f*ck you baby
Go to a movie girl
But I ain't gonna lie, I just wanna f*ck you girl
Said I could take you shopping girl, but I ain't gonna lie
I just wanna f*ck you baby
Oh I could fill your head up girl but I ain't gonna lie
I just wanna f*ck you girl

It take just a little bit of my conversation when I talk
To make it clear for shawty I'm that n*gga in New York
Shawty now lay down, put your head back
I put your legs back, stroke and move your bed back
When we get to those back shots, shawty throw it back
When you back it up at me I like that
Let me guess I turn you on, I turn you on I bet
We just getting started and everything's soaking wet
This pussy good she ain't worry about the rent this month
This pussy must have went and bought this b*tch that Benz out front
For me it's nothing I'm just f*cking for the f*ck of it
But shawty acting like what we just did some other sh*t
It can't be it, it could be, okay maybe she's a good girl
Attracted to me and things from my world
Temptations are great
When tennis bracelets that were eight carats are ten times eight

I could take you to dinner girl but I ain't gonna lie
I just wanna f*ck you baby
Go to a movie girl
But I ain't gonna lie, I just wanna f*ck you girl
Said I could take you shopping girl, but I ain't gonna lie
I just wanna f*ck you baby
Oh I could fill your head up girl but I ain't gonna lie
I just wanna f*ck you girl
How you gonna take this? like a Man or a bitch?
you gon' get it on nigga or you gon' snitch?
I represent niggas in the hood gettin' rich
man, I stack chips and I unload clips
after 3 Summers in the jail I thought life was hard
some niggas started fightin', some niggas found God
you know me, started sellin' leek in the yard
yo, I ran into niggas who used to have Hummers
big as Hell in the joint wearin' '86 numbers
damm Dog, you been in here that long?
you could think that, but say that and yo' ass is dead wrong
a convo is only three words, "yo whattup"
you ain't gotta work out to leave this bitch cut up
let a nigga find out you on some goin' home shit
and you tryin' to bounce without payin' a loan, shit
some niggas beat cases on the strength of they cream
after the witnesses disappeared on the strength of they team
I'm hard as Hell to get along wit' so it never fails
a nigga I got beef with end up in the same jail
he had a L rolled in bible paper blowin' the lye
I sent him a little kite just to be blowin' his high
and when I shot you in NewYork why would I box you now?
If I catch you in the yard I'm'a ox you down
niggas you think is real really can't hold they own
I'll have 'em on some E.T. shit tryin' to phone home
in here a gemstar is like a Nine Milly chrome
it's similar, infact they'll both split ya dome
scars are souvenirs, niggas always take 'em home.

You got blown over the jack? (that ain't gangsta)
Your Man ran when you got clapped? (that ain't gangsta)
rockin' a vest with no gat? (that ain't gangsta)
you only a thug when you rap? (that ain't gangsta)
niggas jooked you for your track? (that ain't gangsta)
you ran to other thugs to get it back? (that ain't gangsta)
niggas ran off with your packs? (that ain't gangsta)
If you ain't bustin' ya gat (that ain't gangsta)

You'd call me an Animal if you seen me livin' on lock
I stay in a box cats be shook when I'm visitin' pop-ulation
when I walk by, niggas like "Fifty don't play Son"
"yeah, somethin' really wrong with that nigga..."
max out, I'm goin' straight for the glock
bust a u-turn, I'm goin' straight to the block
the things that'll happen if niggas say I can't eat
down goes the window... out goes the heat
I'll make the whole block look like a fuckin' trackmeet
some get it in the leg, some get it in the back
some get it in the foot, bleed all over their airmax
nigga pump my packs or pay poor tax
it's extortion, it happens in the hood often
claim more lives than choices, free abortions
Rich Nice says I got a problem with the dice
'cause I put the title to the Benz on the line twice
I rock shit 'cause I stay on that block shit
that 9mm Ruger to your knot shit
see the difference is I'm real and you not, kid
I still stash crack money in my sock, shit
ya'll niggas wanna pop shit? I pop clips
leave with your blood on my mink in the drop Six
Guiliani and Pataki can't stop this
since '86 my whole clique pop Criss.

5-5-1 BLLLAAAP BLLLAAAP!
1-3-4 BLLLAAAP BLLLAAAP!

But you can't hustle a hustler I peeped it and slid
Back then, Niggaz used to call me bo
At six months, I told them, "Million go tops on gar-bo"
Country came around, hes into clappin'
Country left, same shit started happening

Cory shot Drew and we was friends
Money turned boys into men
The cycle never changes, shit just starts again
Naw nigga, ain't nuthin' changed nigga
Yeah, I've been gone for a minute, but I'm back

You see my cherry-red SL nigga, I'm doin' good
Sometimes I can't find the words to say how I feel
So, I take a quote from menace, "Look at the wheels"
I'm addicted to stuntin', now that I'm holdin' something
I got a trunk full of guns from VA to [unverified]
Oh, will you let me hold something? Nigga you high or something?
I don't play games I'm 'bout my money nigga buy something
I got a few 5ths, I got a few 9's
Here nigga, take one
Yeah, don't ever say I don't do nothing for you nigga
You know, don't say I didn't look out for you, know what I mean?
But make sure nigga that you go catch some jokes
When you come back, you gonna have my paper
For that thang thang, know what I'm sayin'?
I don't want it back, don't try to use it then give it back to me
'Cuz I ya'll niggaz now, runnin' around sayin'
50 getting all this rap money and he won't help us, ha ha
Sit tight nigga I'm comin', you know? New shit
All the shit I put out on the mix tapes is for the mix tapes
I got a million
Oh my God, my shit is so hot right now I'm in the zone


Yea, I need you,I need you to hate
So I can use you for your energy
you know, its real shit, feel this!
America's got a thing for this gangsta's shit, they love me
Black Chucks, black skullies, leather Pelle-Pelle
I take spills over raymo shit, I'ma fan
Got through the silver duck tape on my trait old handle
The women on my life bring confusion shit
SO like Nino from New Jack, I'll have to cancel that bitch
Look at me, this is the life I chose
Niggaz around me so cold, man my heart dun froze up
I build an empire on the low the narc's don't know
I'm the weatherman, I take that coco leaf and make that snow
Sit back, watch it turn to dope, watch it go out the door
O after O, you know, homey I'm just triple beam, dreamin
Niggaz be schemin, I'm fiendin to live a good life
The fiends just fiendin
Conceal my weapon nice and easy so you can't see
The penitentiary is definitely out the question for me

I want the finer things in my life
So I hustle (hustle)
Nigga you get in my way when while I'm tryin to get mine
And I'll buck you (buck you)
I don't care who you run with, or where you from
Nigga fuck you (fuck you)
I want to find the thing thats in my life
So I hustle (hustle)
Yea, I don't know shit about gymnastics I summersault bricks
Black talents start flyin, when a nigga flip
I cook crack in the microwave, niggaz can't fuck with me
Man my cold days, they called me chef boy are 50
Check my logic, smokers don't like seeds in their weed shit
Send me them seeds i'll grow 'em what they need
Them ain't chia pet plants in the crib thats chronic
And I'm sellin them 500 a pop god damn it
I sold everythin I'ma hustler, I know how to grind
Step on grapes put in water and tell you its wine
If you analyze me, what you'll find is the DNA recrock
What goes in my mind, its contagious
Hypnotic, it sounds melodic
If the rap was the block or spider, I'll be poke and butter
Now get a load of me, flashy, far from low key
And you can locate me where ever that dope be, gettin money man

Its a hustler's ambition, close your eyes listen, see my vision
Mossberg pumpin, shotgun dumpin and drama means nothin
It's part of the game, catch me in the coupe switchin lanes
In the jewels with your chains
I upgrade from 30 BS to clean VS
Rocks that I copped procedes from the spot
I got the energy to win, I'm full of adrenaline
Played it perf and get nauseous, watchin the spinner spin
I make plans to make it, a prisoner of the state
Now I can invite yo ass out to my estate
Them holi tip bent me up, but I'm back in shape
Pour Crystal in the blender and make a protein shake
I'm like the East coast number one playboy B
Hugh Hefner'll tell you he don't got shit on me
The feds watch me, icey they can't stop me
Racist, pointin at me look at the nigga ratchi
Hello!


Hats off, to da rich ones who flash and floss
Pour some liquors out to my dogs trapped up north
Reminisce on the deceased who no longer exist
Only wishin' we could bring them back with songs like dis
Old flicks on us chillin' wit da old time click
Holdin' nines, thoughts of death, not our lives we risk
How it use to be, early morn, pumpin' in shifts
Jakes wit pale faces in the night is the scariest
They handcuff me, they knew my government and alias
Various calls were made up for awarin' us
The D's in the marked vans and cabs
In our land, hoodrats get stapped by niggas who forty
Turnin' out young lady's and make them make thoughties
Got them coked out, the hood is bugged out
Thug babies, famous in they strollers
Before they walk they knew the hood talk
It's in the air of New York
So everybody'll pick em up, kissin em up
Treatin' them like they own, in dis hood we call home
Fist fight till we grown and these guns come out
Circle of life, it's kinda deep how we end out.

Yo them niggas that wanted beef before
Don't want no beef no mo
Now that they know who I rep with
QB NIGGA!!!
Who I rep with
QB NIGGA!!! [repeat]

Ya'll niggas better sober up before ya'll speak to me, don't come at me high
Last rapper that raised his voice to me, got japped in da eye
Now if I say I'm gone get you, I'ma get ya
On da strength of da inf, from long range I can hit ya
You find out them niggas who wit ya ain't even wit ya
After da gem stars split ya, you need an MD to stitch ya
Peep how I use words to paint pictures
Peep how I got niggas with bodies askin' me for ten cents to got hit ya
Look my name up in the law book, Curtis Jackson
Known for creatin' action, by rapidly clappin'
Nigga I stay strapped, so much I nickname gats
Got a tech I call Tina, a nine I name Nina
Two niggas went to see Allah afta they seen her
This QB shit, bout to take me to da next level
Next crib, next Benz, next bitch, next bezel.
It's that real.


Yo, aiyyo, who da fuck wanna war
I got a four four, pierce ya'll niggas jaw
You see me thugged out, iced out, Guinness Stout
Hopin' out the Range wit da gun out
Smack your man down, you ran off
I was gonna hit him with two, I left some for you
I put four, QB rugged and raw
I got somethin' for these rap cats, fish held back gats
Scope wit a beam on it, loc put your cream on it
Shine don't scheme on it, I make your dream about it
Forever, whatever whatever get gully
Shots thru your leather and clothe, With your skelly off
Break ya'll clowns off
Yo hollow tips will flood your jacket, I don't give a fuck who you be
Millennium Thug, now who da fuck want it with me.
I mastered the art of slap boxin' niggas in da dark
QB's big man, Horse of the Bravehearts
I'm da Sasquash of rap, collector of gats
Testin' macks at your bulletproof vests and hats.
How bout that, guns bust off, I bust back
When trucks backfire, I bust back
How bout that, stomp a muhfuckin' rib out ur back
Ya'll niggas ain't gangsta rap, ya'll click like Josey and the Pussycats
When we come around da front, stop.
Uh huh, ya'll can't fuck around ya'll get dropped
When guns pop, who's tellin'
Twin barrel nines wavin' and yellin', QB NIGGA WHAT
Two-time felon, straight to da melon, straight to da dome
Send a nigga back, get da shells, go straight home
Never slip, my +Ill Will+ to survive is so deep
Can't sleep, cousin to death, makes me weak
Pullin' triggers at my shadow, Bravehearts pop up
Wiz, Jungle and Horse shot your block up.

Them niggas that wanted war before
Don't want no war no mo
Now that they know who I rep wit
QB NIGGA!!
Who I rep wit
QB NIGGA!! [repeat]
Yo Black is flashy like Alpo gun happy like Pappy
Sneaky muthafucka remind me of nigga that crack me
He aint the type you shoot dice with and win dog
Unless you want to get your ass layed out in gilmore
Yes we soldiers, remind me Troy and E-Bags
When they came through they hollored like 'What up Conrad?'
Grimey niggaz they loved to get gully
Summertime still had on black gloves and scullies
The Lex 450 pulled up that's Cornbread
Them niggaz from Philly would of called him an old head
But he an OG remind me of Chaz and Bump real low key
Sounded like he didn't know nothing about drama
For this money shit many men do trauma
Switchy walked in son, this bitch had the baddest ass
The bulletproof glass was rolled up on the S-Class
Heard in DC he kept mad blocks in order
Picture this a young nigga gettin it like Rich Porter
Sonny came in for half a pit
He got knocked, he on lock still controllin' his block from constop
Pop pulled up in the CL5 his project changed
His man just got fucking murked by Salene
Heard he got it in the range nigga Bean popped one in his brain
Over some-thing took his watch and his chain
Country boys off the hook down there and Richmond main.
In the black 740 I sat, hat turned back
Bow down baby nelly singing my wrist blinging What!
I'm waiting on this nigga Wise we lost for two pies
Son he smokin that shit I can see it in his eyes
Coming up wise emotions closed
Most buying round looking for wisemen toast
Benny hopped out the Esculade with a few thourough men from B-More
They sellin heroin in Maryland reverse back to Diesel
Killed like 4 fiends his popularity grew that only meant more cream
First it was him and his brother now he got a team
Went from 5 and a half grams to living the dream
City pulled up Goddamn you know his format
Bentley is all marble in the door and floor match
Got the gats out the stash box popped 2 glocks
Peace "All Eyez on Me" 2Pac
Everybody know he a boss he gotta floss
He on the same bullshit that sent Gotti up north
That's Dime in the blue ts stunting like he Nicky Barnes
He broke but he talk like he a Don
Homes hoppin out the Jag that's Max haitian cat
Kill a nigga quick remind me of Haitian Jack
I peep his style son I know his stelo, He on the d-low
He smile at niggaz mumbling fuck you in Creole
Heard war stories bout how he maneuver with the Ruger
Hold the iron horizontally and send shots through ya
Few niggaz tried to murk him, most them got fount
Some turnt away try to run they in wheelchairs now
Banks hopped out bulletproof this, bulletproof that
Bulletproof snorkel, bulletproof hat
Got out a Black hummer he blew 90 on that
Poppin mad shit like he gonna bulletproof that lets go
50 Cent]
Ah-ha man! Ay you know where them niggaz be at right?
{*click-clack*} Take me to 'em

All through the hood I keep hearin niggaz sayin
- I'm supposed to die tonight
Niggaz done put a hit out and they talkin like the shit okay
- I'm down to ride tonight
We rollin, whip stolen, AK golden
- I'm down to ride tonight
Weed smokin, straight loc'n, lock and loadin
- Somebody gon' die tonight

This is nuttin new, I been in this position before
Grandma crib, niggaz outside of her door
Different day same shit, old mac new clip
32 hollow-tips, gloves, no rubber grip
I'm a boss, but niggaz never show no respect
I catch 'em slippin, I'll have 'em tongue-kissin my tec
Gwan come, test me, pussy bwoy, don't try it
Police response never fast enough to shots fired
Don't be stupid, find out who you fuckin with son
'Fore we find out where yo' bitch get her hair and nails done
It's elementary, life is but a dream
You know row row your boat, your blood forms a stream
After you get hit, you shoulda thought about the shit
You took that paper you take a life or yo' life get took bitch
Sometimes I sit and look at life from a different angle
Don't know if I'm God's child or I'm Satan's angel


In 2002, if you asked me to make a wish
I simply woulda wished that my music would be a hit
Big said, "Damn - niggaz wanna stick me for my paper"
"And pray for my downfall," I understand it all
But me, I'm a little more flashy a nigga
So chances are, I'ma have to blast me a nigga
I'm on that Kevlar and vest shit, that wild wild West shit
There's eighty-one one carat stones in my necklace
I shine so hard, I make motherfuckers wan' kill me
Every projects in every hood I go, they feel me
Know it sounds like rap, but this shit is real B
I don't talk that rich shit, but nigga I'm filthy
When I come out to play, and my mob ain't with me
You can bet your bottom dollar that revolver with me
Homeboy, frontin on me'll shorten your lifespan
Hold the mic with my left, my knife in my right hand
YEAH!


Aight, check this shit out, ya'll niggas gon' stay in the car, I'm'a go
right over here and see somethin', gimme ten minutes, If I don't come
out, ya'll come in, the money stays in the car 'till I say
so.......aiyo, whattup whattup, man, this is what ya'll niggas is
workin' wit' for 22 cents a gram?
Man, when I come up in here treat me like I'm fam
I could go Uptown and get this shit for 16 cents a gram
bottom line is, man, I gotta cop and go
I got a spot and I can't afford to stop the flow
Poppi, what the fuck is the matter wit' ya Man?
standin' against the wall with a gun in his hand
I ain't on no funny shit I'm on some get this money shit
every four days in PA I move another brick
according to the DA I sold dope in VA
my crew stay in Queens but my plates say VA
I'll show you where I rest at, it aint hard to find me
let me buy a brick and get the other on cossimy
 I know, don't remind me
If I catch another case I'ma kill Guiliani
It ain't even safe to sell a pack at night
got task ridin' 'round the Projects on Mountain Bikes
Chorus -
NY ain't the same, it's OT playa
you can go and cop coke from the corner Bodega
hit the highway and take it to a town near you, and get that money man,
get that money man. (Repeat)

Now, if you come to 1-3-4 and I'm not around
that means I copped and I went outta town
you mothafukkas know how I get down
about my money man, about my money man.
Aiyo, I know these niggas don't like me
But I don't like none of ya'll niggas, you know what I'm sayin
50 cent, 9-9, motherfuckin doo wop
Volume 3, take it however the fuck you wan' take it
Faggot ass niggas (50 Cent show these niggas how to rock)
Yo, they done shot that boy down like a dog in the street
Left him smelly, man fuck that, roll em over take that fellas pellet
You ain't never heard a motherfucker spit like this
Not even puff, and that nigga there made crazy hits
Every few years a nigga come who crazy hot
I'm the next best thing since Biggie and Pac
Now I'm sayin this shit slow, so you don't miss it
Don't be a statistic, my jewels from the district
Stay with my biscuit, touch mines and get twisted
Son I'm off the meter, my mind locked on crime
See I'm tired of all these rappin niggas dyin to shine
And I'm tired of fiends askin for a dime for nine
Hearing this next punch line from me, may sound strange
You sit your 5-dollar ass down, before I make change
Yo the sale went stale, caught em real bad
Fresh out the jail, shit is really real
Niggas is still in jail, and I pray they don't tell
20-man inditement, my lawyer gotta fight this
Niggas know, I ain't never pressed for dough
And niggas know, I don't serve nobody I don't know
Son said he was from O.T., pay 11 an o.z.
My man brought em to me, see he ain't really know b
That it was hot, dude was a cop
He was just tryin to pop, to put the new beams on his drop
First I served him o.z.'s, then I served him whole keys
Now we all co-de's, damn man I O.D.
You know how it is on the street, niggas is holdin the heat
Po-Po walking to beat, we burnin l's up in the jeep
Ain't nothing sweet, we used to move so strategic
It's over I can't believe it, damn it's over
Fed's ceased the six, the Lex' and the Range Rover
Now a nigga rollin in a Toyota Corolla
Used to never get high, now I'm never sober
380-6 shot glock top load-up
Keep it in my waist son, I'll put one in your face
I ain't got nothing to lose, nigga so stay in your place
Just jumped bail, I ain't been on the run long
But it feel like a motherfuckin marathon

If a bitch don't like me
Somethin' wrong with the bitch (fuck that bitch)
Why... oh why... why... you wanna fuck with me now?
Yo Dave, that shit come with the game baby, the money, you know
thats how the shit work, you know what I'm sayin'
they supposed to love me now baby
I'm doin' it now baby
hahahaha

Girl, what makes you wanna fuck with me now?
I've been wantin' to fuck wit' you for quite a while
Is the money makin' you wanna fuck with me?
The money gonna make you sell your soul

Whoa... if money's gonna make me slam these hoes... then alright
Whattup Shorty, I ain't seen you in many moons
talk to me, how's life been treatin' you? good I hope
you got a smile that only a fool would forget
and a figure that'll leave a nigga droolin' and shit
There I was, kickin' my game, pickin' her brain
buggin' 'cause a while back I met this bitch on the train
she wasn't feelin' me, I pulled up, she wouldn't talk from the whip
Uptown girl, she feel like thats some chickenhead shit
but on the sidewalk we ain't play games
we exchanged numbers and names
I went back to the Range
I heard her Girlfriend whisperin' "I know that nigga, he rich"
she think I got six whips 'cause me and my Man switch
anyway, her name is CeCe
she said she go to BMCC
push a '98 328 with chrome BB's
she said she seen me in the Onyx video on TV
she liked my part the best, man, this bitch is tryin' to G me.


It's hard as Hell to find a Girl thats really down for ya
type that'll hold down the Tre pound for ya
they into diamonds now, to Hell with pearls
these trick niggas fucked up, they done gave 'em the World
Hey Shorty, why you like me? huh? you like the way I spit?
oh, I hit your girlfriend, she told you 'bout the dick?
nah for real, am I the type that you wanna roll wit'?
platinum iced out, got rid of that gold shit
I love my lifestyle, you too, you love it
that I could blow Twenty Thousand and think nothin' of it
know you wouldn't fuck with me if I had no ends
probably wouldn't fuck in the whip if it wasn't a Benz
I guess life looks different through them Shanel tints
Man, I don't care if these hoes love me or not
long as I rhyme hot I'm gettin' head in my drop
it goes on and on and on and it don't stop.


One thing you can always count on is change
and a rich nigga to come put shit in the game
had a 4.0 then Jigga made you trade your Range
would've felt broke if you couldn't get your change
now it's hard to find us or stay behind us
while we on the 900 double R Hondas
watch the cats who flip bricks recline in the latest whips
while Penetentiaries stay packed with cats who sling packs
all these hoes ain't Madonna fans but all across the World
you can find a material Girl
I sip Dom 'till I earl
take 'em two at a time
quick I get in they mind
have 'em thinkin' they mine
bust off then tell 'em "Bust a Uey, on mo' time"
I'm like the reason ya'll niggas can't eat this year
got your bitch breakin' her neck to peep this here
c'mon... uh huh... c'mon

Fuck you bitch! leave me alone, walk on... get the fuck on...
Yo, Shorty... tell your friends ya'll ain't fuckin' with us...
aww man... look... he ain't mean that shit...
c'mon thats just records... niggas is playin'...
we wasn't serious and shit...

Uh huh, uh huh, uh huh
Southside, what y'all niggas know about the dirty south?
One time

Lord forgive me, for I've sinned
Over and over again, just to stay on top
I recall memories, filled with sin
Over and over again, and again
Yo, when you hear talk of the southside, you hear talk of the team
See niggas feared Prince and respected Preme
For all you slow muthafuckas I'm a break it down iller
See Preme was a business man and Prince was the killer
Remember, he used to push the bulletproof BM, uh huh
This here get ya seasick, I sat back and peeped shit
The roll with Easy Wider and they ain't get blunted
Had the whole projects workin for fifty on five-hundred
As a youth, all I ever did was sell crack
I used to idolize cat
Hurt me to my heart to hear that nigga snitched on Pap, how he go out like
that?
Rumors in the hood was Jes was snitchin
I ain't believe that, pa, he helped me cop my first GSX-R
Had the four-runner, the Z, the 5 and the 3
Used to drive his truck through the hood draggin jet skis
From Gerald Wallace to Baby Wise, don't be suprised
Of how freely I thought of names of guys who dealt with pies
Like LA and Wise, L got shot in the neck, then told his connect
Them niggas who shot 'em got 'em for ten bricks
Fuckin Dominicans, turned around and gave 'em more bricks

That first verse is just a dose of the shit that I'm on
Consider this the first chapter in the ghetto's Quran
I know a lot of niggas that get dough like Bimmy and Joe
And Prince and Rightous from Hillside with the mole on his nose
Throughout my struggles through the hood, I started learnin
Life's a bitch, with a pretty face, but she burnin
Man I'm a get cheese like Chaz then run through whips like Cigar
Gamble all the time like country-curly head Prince and Tata
Po-po under pressure too, they know what they facin
Go against crews like B-Bo and killers like Pappy Mason
A lotta niggas I know been corrupted since birth
Enticed to rob nuns for fun, for everything they worth
I know some cats that hail at old complexes like Cooley Wall
Together niggas stand and divided they fall
Round here, shook niggas they keep it in motion
Come around here with your rollie you can get robbed like Ocean
Lord knows, Tommy had loved and sold
Helicopters, Rolls Royces with Louie Vuitton interior
Might sound like I'm fantasizin, but son I'm dead serious
Montanna was no dummy, brought Benice to wash the money
Had money out the ass, he politic like the Asian
FEDs couldn't catch him dirty so settled for tax evasion

Yo, rest in peace to Rich and Ron, money what they was about yo
The twins was from queens but got crazy cream with Alpo
Throughout my time I heard tales of Himey, Frenchy, Jamaican Pauly, Ducky
Cally
Rodney Bump and Chick, shit
A lot a niggas flow the way I flow
but ain't been in the game all their life so don't know who I know
Writin rhymes is the best way I express how I feel
If I ain't rich by twenty-six, I'll be dead or in jail
Comin up I heard sippin to much booze'll leave you confused
And if you watch the news you see playas in this game that lose
I'm forgettin Lefty and Jazz, Pretty Tony and Lance
Head Lou, Mel son, Troy and E Money Bags
And a conversation over shrimp and lobster
And Benny Hiners heard Chico stopped boxin, and started robbin diners
Shout out to Clanvis and Clutch, Bob Dre, Black Will
If the flow don't kill you the Mac will


Yeah... Shady
Haha (Wooo)
50 Cent... GgGgG G Unit
Haha (Here we go again)
Yeah Uh huh (Haha)

Does it make you mad when I switch my flow
You can't understand how I get my dough
50 Cent I'm on fire 'cause shady said so... I'm On Fire

Here we go now
Everybodies in a rush to try to get the throne
I just get on the track and try to set the tone
Ain't trying to use nobody as a steppin' stone
But don't compare me I'm better off just left alone
And I ain't even tryin' to go there with record sales
I'm just tryin' to keep it humble and respect myself
Say what what up keep steppin' and just rep D12
Keep my nose clean stay away from weapons jail
And livin' wreckless, but if you would check my belt
You may see soemthing else I use to protect myself
A vest to stop a ruger and deflect the shells and
Send em back at you faster than they left the barrel
And I don't even carry guns no more I don't got to
Got under cover cops that'll legally pop you
And I done seen a lot of people crossed the line
But this motherfucker Ja mustve lost his mind
That X has got him thinkin' that he was DMX
Then he switched to Pac now his tryin' to be him next
So which one are you X Luther Pac or Michael ?
Just keep singing the same song recycled
We'd all much rather get along than fight you
Me and hailey dance to your songs we like you
And you don't really want to step inside on my group
Come on now you know the white boy will bite you
I'll hurt your pride dog and you know I don't like to
But I will if I have to
With syllable after syllable ill just slap ya
Killin' you faster
Than you poppin' pill after little pill of them tabs of
That shit you on but if you want it you got it
You'd bump this shit too if we didn't diss you on it
But if we lock horns we can charge harder than Busta
We bump heads with any motherfucker that wants ta
So what's the deal where was all of the tough talk
When I walked up to ya like Ja what up dog
How come you didn't say you had a problem then
When you was standin' there with all you men
We could've solved it then I'm a grown man dogg come holla
All you did was slap hands smile and swallow
Another one of them lil x pills in front of me
And tell me 50 Cent was everything you want to be (Cmon)

I know you don't want it with me
You know you don't want it with me
You can talk I'm still the m.c
You don't want to bump heads with me
You couldn't slug me if my father helped you
My punchlines is hot my bars would melt you
Ja, you... stuart little, shells will lift you
Every other week I'm buyin' a new pistol
I clap at yo ass with this chrome 38
And put 6 through yo hat so seven in 3 eights (?)
Erv you ain't shug knight you shook light
I put my knife in ya wind pipe
Then freeze on this turn pike
You know and I know who took ya chain
You got rolled two times so your ass is lame
I'm down to die for this shit all I need is bail
You better stick to the movies with segal

Yo fuck that I'm tired of these -
Industry niggas [unknown] you get out of hand
I'm gone find you whereabouts [unknown]
We kill in new york even in Compton they understand
I'm on the block where you was raised [unknown]
They see me poppin' more ice because I could [unknown]
You probably forgot your way around the hood, good
Least when your paranoid its hard to make a song
How you want it with us and laugh [unknown] got make up on
Every magazine I open you on your knees takin' prayer pictures
And you ain't even got shot yet you scared bitches
You don't know nothin' bout what pain is sucker
I put put your ass in the ground like a train conductor motherfucker

Yeah Nigger
Shady Aftermath
G Unit
Fuck you think they call us G Unit for
'Cause we move units
Uh Huh
And don't think we ain't billin' you for this motherfuckin' studio time
Matter fact keep em on 50
We call it even. Ha
Nobody likes me
Nobody likes me, but that's okay
Cause I don't like y'all anyway
And I don't like y'all anyway
Fuck all y'all!
My watch talk for me, my whip talk for me
My gat talk for me
What up homie
For bitches who don't know me
They want to blow me 'cause the shit I floss wit sayin a lot for me
I came into rap humble, I don't give a fuck now
Serve anybody like niggas who hustle uptown
Coke price go up, cats is come down
The D's run in my crib, I'm nowhere to be found
The bitch who hustle for me, they don't even stash tracks
They keep it on em, right there in they ass crack
When I don't like a nigga, I don't pretend to
I'll have the paramedics wrap your fucking head like a Hindu
Look, I ain't going nowhere, so get used to me
OG's look at me and see what they used to be
I'm that nigga that sold coke, the nigga that sold dope
The nigga that shot Dice when he broke to So So
The thug, they pop shit
The thug that pop clips
The thug that went from three and a half to whole bricks
Nigga ain't in his right mind, going against me
My picture's painted through words that make a blind man see
Scream murder! (I don't believe you!)
Murder! (Fuck around and leave you!)
Murder! (I don't believe you!)
Murder, murder! (Your life's on the line!)
Y'all niggas don't want no parts of me
I'm trying to figure out how y'all started me
Make me catch her on the late night
Pop shots wit the fifth and slide off wit the six
I'm not a marksmen while spark issue, I spray random
Not a pretty nigga but my moms think I'm handsome
I hate to hear "He say, She say" shit
Unless he say she say she on my dick
It's no coincidence, niggas who fuck wit me get shot up
I do a Cali style drive by and tear ya block up
You soft through, be putting up a crazy front
I stay wit the Mac, 'cause niggas tried to blaze me once
In the hood they be like, "Damn, 50 really spitted on em"
"You heard that shit?" "Yeah, 50 really shitted on em"
Beef, you don't want none, so don't start none
You just a small player in this game, play a part son
Scream murder! (I don't believe you!)
Murder! (Fuck around and leave you!)
Murder! (I don't believe you!)
Murder, murder! (Your life's on the line!)
These cats always escape reality when they rhyme
That's why they write about bricks and only dealt wit dimes
Leave it to them, and they say they got a fast car
Nascar, truck wit a crash bar
And TV's in the dash, pa
See em in the five wit stock rims, I just laugh, pa
I catch stunts when I ain't trying
I ain't lying, I sit Don P til I split up
Keep my rent split up
Get outta line, I get you hit up
Now if you say my name in your rhyme, watch what you say
You get carried away, you can get shot and carried away

50, Jay-Z and Nas
I'ma say this shit now and never again
We ain't buddies, we ain't partners and we damn sure ain't friends
The games you playing, you get killed like that
Acting like you all hard, you ain't built like that
See me when you see me nigga, one
Scream murder! (I don't believe you!)
Murder! (Fuck around and leave you!)
Murder! (I don't believe you!)
Murder, murder! (Your life's on the line!)
Y'all niggas don't want no parts of me

Homie you ain't been through what I been through
You not like me and i'm not like you

Got semi-autos to put holes in niggaz tryina play me
One shot is not enough you need least a uzi to move me
After four bottles of Dom the kid start feelin' woozy

I'm gangsta to the core nigga you can't move me
I found my space at the top I got this rap shit locked

Green Lantern... Shady Records...

Rule number one don't go against the grain
Rule number two give respect where respect due
Rule number three if you get knocked play games and say names
 the 45 will tear you out the frame
Its like the rich get richer and the poor don't get fuckin thing
Don't mean nothin changed but the things my money bring
My style will leave you aggy like them cats in jail
You peoples got pleany money actin like they ain't got bail
I feel for you niggas gettin shot while I'm sayin this rhyme
Or niggas in the mess hall gettin shot on shallow lines
An old timer schooled me don't burn bridges my friend
Imagine the G-Dub close and yo ass gotta swim
I watch the fifth melt a nigga melt a nigga of the sidewalk of New York
Me and shorty saw from afar and had a talk
He said I told em if he came around I'd clap him, I gave him my word
Look at his head its still shakin he had alot of nerve
If it wasn't for the flow
I'd probably have to double Back bubble crack
yea yea I'm a hustler
If it wasn't for the flow
I'd probably have to double Back bubble crack
yea yea I'm a hustler
If it wasn't for the flow
I'd probably have to double Back bubble crack
yea yea I'm a hustler
Yo when the fed come in the game loyalty is limited
Hardcore niggas start actin feminine
With the feds you do eighty five percent of your time
Duke you get ten you'll damn near do nine
Hate a liar more than I hate thief
A thief is only after my salary a liar is after my reality
The streets I know'em like my ABC's
Stay away from the D's and stack ya cheese
Try to see three hundred g's fore you see three hundred C's
Tree top to feel the breeze co connect for key's
Yo bitches sexin me take me to ecstacy
Once I nut (ahh oh shit) I don't want 'em next to me
If its on mother fucker believe I'm gonna ride
I'm the type to swallow my blood fore I swallow my pride
Letters on my shirt read DKNY
Got grimy niggas runnin with me from BKNY
If it wasn't for the flow
I'd probably have to double Back bubble crack
yea yea I'm a hustler
They say I don't sound like a killer well how a killer sound
I bet I grab a foe pound and back that ass down
See many men live baby and many men die
Many men get drunk puff lah and stay high
Here's a jewel love you enemies and hate your friends
Your enemies remain the same friends always change
I don't quit that theres more that one way to skin a cat
You can get him in the face dog or down his back
All bullshit aside now its time to be honest
I fear no man for death is all thats promised
I got niggas standin in line waitin to hear me spit
From eighty six to ninety six the game went from sugar to shit
This for you niggas in the background dyin to shine
I hate you like fiends who ask for a dime for nine
Don't nothin change in the game but faces and names
Skate to wait to date and the jake
If it wasn't for the flow
I'd probably have to double Back bubble crack
yea yea I'm a hustler
Uh, huh, uh, huh, uh, huh, South side
What y'all niggas know about the dirty south?
One time
Lord forgive me for I've sinned
Over and over again just to stay on top
I recall memories filled with sin
Over and over again, and again
Yo, when you hear talk of the south side, you hear talk of the team
See niggas feared Prince and respected Preme
For all you slow muthafuckas I'm a break it down iller
See Preme was a business man and Prince was the killer
Remember, he used to push the bulletproof BM, uh, huh
This here get ya seasick, I sat back and peeped shit
They roll with Easy Rider and they ain't get blunted
Had the whole projects workin' for fifty on five-hundred
As a youth, all I ever did was sell crack
I used to idolize cat, heart me in my heart
To hear that nigga snitched on Pat
How he go out like that?
Rumors in the hood was [unverified] was snitchin'
I ain't believe that, pa, he helped me cop my first GSX-R
Had the four-runner, the Z, the 5 and the 3
Used to drive his truck through the hood draggin' jet skis
From Gerald Wallace to Baby Wise, don't be surprised
Of how freely I thought of names of games who dealt with pies
Like L A N Y's, L got shot in the neck, then told us connect
Them niggas who shot 'em got 'em for ten bricks
Fuckin' Dominicans turned around and gave 'em more bricks
Lord forgive me, for I've sinned
Over and over again just to stay on top
I recall memories filled with sin
Over and over again, and again
That first verse is just a dose of the shit that I'm on
Consider this the first chapter in the ghetto's Qu Ran
I know a lot of niggas that get dough like Remmy and Joe
And Prince and Righteous from Hillside with the mole on his nose
Throughout my struggles through the hood, I started learnin'
Life's a bitch with a pretty face but she burnin'
Man, I'm a get cheese like Chaz then run through wips like Cigar
Gamble all the time like country-curly head Prince and Tata
Popo under pressure too, they know what they facin'
Go against crews like B-Bo and killers like Patty Mason
A lotta niggas I know been corrupted since birth
Enticed to rob nuns for fun, for everything they worth
I know some cats that hail at old complexes like Cooley Wall
Together niggas stand and divided they fall
'Round here, shook niggas they keep it in motion
Come around here with your rollie you can get robbed like Ocean
Lord knows, Tommy had loved and sold
Helicopters, Rolls Royce's with Louie VaTonne interior
Might sound like I'm fantasizin', but son I'm dead serious
Montanna was no dummy, brought Benice to watch the money
Had money out the ass, he politic like the Asian
Fed's couldn't catch him dirty so settled for tax evasion
Lord forgive me, for I've sinned
Over and over again just to stay on top
I recall memories filled with sin
Over and over again, and again
Yo, rest in peace to Rich and Ron, money what they was about yo
The twins was some queens but got crazy cream with Alpo
Throughout my time I heard tales of Himey
Frenchy, Jamaican Pauly, Ducky, Cally
Rodney Bump and Chick, shit, a lot a niggas flow the way I flow
But ain't been in the game all their life so don't know who I know
Writin' rhymes is the best way I express how I feel
If I ain't rich by twenty-six, I'll be dead or in jail
Comin' up I heard sippin' too much booze'll leave you confused
And if you watch the news you see playas in this game that lose
I'm forgettin' Lefty and Jazz, Pretty Tony and Lance
Head Lou, Mel son, Troy and E Money Bags
And a conversation over shrimp and lobster
And Benny Hiners heard Chico stopped boxin'
And started robbin' diners, shout out to Clanvis and Clutch
Bob Dre, Black Will, if the flow don't kill you the Mac will
Lord forgive me for I've sinned
Over and over again just to stay on top
I recall memories filled with sin
Over and over again, and again

You rattin on niggas is only gon' leave you smoked
So the only thing left now is toast for these cowrads
I got no friends, fuck most of these cowards
They pop shit 'till we start approaching these cowards
While we lay around dollars, they lay around flowers

I got a intergangstress who argue and steams wit reefer
And who flip when I call a bitch like she Queen Latifah
Not all the vehicle's is long enough to stash the streetsweeper
This shit can get uglier than the Master P sneaker
We slidin through the ruckus, wit prada on the chuckus
Soon as spring break ho's home from college wanna fuck us
I ain't here to drop knowledge on you suckas
I'll sick rottweiler's on you fuckas, cops followin to cuff us
Top dollars to discuss this, whole lotta zeros
When it comes to paper I blow a soul outta aero
I'ma break before I lay floor berry
Besides, every rapper ain't a star, nigga plad ain't bulbary
You can't tame Lloyd, smokin by the big screen
You changin the channel looks like I'm playin the game boy

But reach and I'll put a dot on ya head like its part of yo religion
Why party wit a pigeon?

I'm in the gucci vest wit the green and red straps
I'm the last rapper to scare niggas since Craig Mack
Now every morning's a fast start
And there aint problem gettin dressed 'cause my closet got more aisles than pathmark
Run, move startin to raid

We just find out what club they at

I don't know what you heard about me
But a bitch can't get a dollar out of me
No Cadillac, no perms, you can't see
That I'm a motherfucking P-I-M-P
Now shorty, she in the club, she dancing for dollars
She got a thing for that Gucci, that Fendi, that Prada
That BCBG, Burberry, Dolce and Gabbana
She feed them foolish fantasies, they pay her cause they want her
I spit a little G, man, and my game got her
A hour later have that ass up in the Ramada
Them trick niggas in her ear saying they think about her
I got the bitch by the bar trying to get a drink up out her
She like my style, she like my smile, she like the way I talk
She from the country, think she like me cause I'm from New York
I ain't that nigga trying to holla cause I want some head
I'm that nigga trying to holla cause I want some bread
I could care less how she perform when she in the bed
Bitch, hit that track, catch a date, and come and pay the kid

If you fucking with me, I'm a P-I-M-P
Not what you see on TV, no Cadillac, no greasy
Head full of hair, bitch, I'm a P-I-M-P
Come get money with me if you curious to see
How it feels to be with a P-I-M-P
Roll in the Benz with me, you could watch TV
From the backseat of my V, I'm a P-I-M-P
Girl, we could pop some champagne and we could have a ball
We could toast to the good life, girl, we could have it all
We could really splurge, girl, and tear up the mall
If ever you needed someone I'm the one you should call
I'll be there to pick you up if ever you should fall
If you got problems I can solve 'em, they big or they small
That other nigga you be with ain't 'bout shit

I said the walls have ears lil' nigga, I hear when you talk,
Let's get this shit clear lil' nigga, I run New York

I wake up, stare at the ceilin',
I'm alive, what a beautiful feelin',
I put my vest on right after I put on my drawers,
It's a habit I'm always prepared for war,
See my life's like some shit, you seen in a flick,
Bitches act like pornstars when they sit on a dick,
When I was hit and out the game I said "one more flick",
Test my aim in the range I'm like "one more clip",
It's my brain, I'm insane, I be on some shit,
Man I run Interscope, Jada's tryna annoy me,
Nuthin' but another disgruntled employee,
He been in the game ten years and he still ain't rich,
Even his mama upset that he still ain't shit,
And he keep runnin his yap, like I'ma take all that,
One more word out his mouth I'll push Style's shit back,
See the nozzle on my tre pound is three inches long,
And the trigger on the fo' fo's extremly strong,
With a little tre douche is like pop, pop,
Chase his ass up the block til his bitch ass drop,
And the verses he be kickin' none of 'em hot,
Cos he ain't got none of that shit he says he got,
And he ain't did none of that shit he said he did,
And I ain't got time to be talkin 'bout this shit, (fuckin' faggot)

I guess it's easy to see lil' nigga, I run New York,
Yeah I live in CC lil' nigga, but I run New York,
And I don't go to parties lil' nigga, but I run New York,
And I stay gettin Cs lil' nigga, cos I run New York


My gun is longer than yours, nigga, call your recouster,

Jada fuckin punchlines, my serp went platinum,
Style's and sheek louch went double plastic,
Yayo, Buck and Banks was puttin out classics,
A hundred shots, a hundred clips, y'all ready to die,
Fat Joe ain't a gangsta, he afraid to fly,
Automatic mossberg, who want a piece of this punk,
I had Ja Rule buryed and some high heel punk,
Feds stuck in a bullet-proof, man fuck that,
Homie, shoot up my whip, you only leave a scratch,
Yo, I slip cocaine, in your hotel lobby,
And beat you wit my pistol like Kane did Charlie,
It's T.O.N.Y.Y.A.Y.O.,
My whole clique got doe, my Os on the fly hole,
C4s, we fly on linz,
And my rocks lookin like, Flex likes yo' benz,

When I'm down in DC lil' nigga, I tell 'em, I run New York,
When I'm out in Philly lil' homie, I run New York,
When I'm in VA I tell niggaz guess what, I run New York,

White on white, ya like? Red I flight the night
From L.A. to N.Y. I'm Harlem bound
You see how bitches tense up, when Scarlett 'round
Niggas get the heart to holla while we up in the club
But get intimidated when they see me sitting on dubs
I hear 'em whispering, "That ain't a man, shit that's her"
She roll with them G Unit niggas, that's what's up
Disrespect me, I'll have niggas blast ya up
Take my advice, don't let ya peoples grass ya up

Jim Star crush your head, give your ass a shape-up
Uptown niggas known for the money they make
Everybody ain't shook, you see doing the shake
The boss spending ends
Saying, "Gimme that Benz, 20 inch rims, and four TV's"
The snitch in the precinct saying
"He sell X, he sell techs, and he sell D"
The balla by the bar saying
"Everybody drink, the best champagne, it's all on me"
Snitch in the back of the police car
Pointing out the window saying, "He robbed me"
It's elementary

Lloyd Banks' in the house
Now get the fuck on the floor I slid through the front door
With the 9 and the velor, a cal in my pocket
You will, I'ma pop it, I'm down for a profit
I'm ghetto as hell, you can't you tell?
My road dog, under the jail getting frustrating mail
So I'm drinking and smoking thinking and hoping
This cell gon' open, you can dance next to me
But don't throw an elbow, I'll throw one back
And leave blood on your Shell Toes
Hell no I ain't paying for pleasure
Your pussy don't bring rainbows and pots of treasure
It's every girl's dream, to floss with the team
Long on the suine, DVD's on the screen
Blowing on cream waiting for you to scheme
You ain't gotta know how to read, to spray a magazine
The boss spending ends
Saying, "Gimme that Benz, 20 inch rims, and four TV's"
The snitch in the precinct saying
"He sell X, he sell techs, and he sell D"

Go 'head and stunt, see I don't pop two your wig
I'm artistic, intelligent, so much ability
When I use them big words, your bitch be feeling me
So y'all niggas hate me, 'cause your wives be our groupies
Y'all irritate me, like loud people in the movies
Fall back, matter fact back down
'Cause I just passed security without no pat down
You can catch me in the bathroom blowing a sticky
Or catch me on the dance floor feeling some tits
Sex sells, so I'ma P I M P
So my pockets never be empty
It ain't no problem, we scoop them models
We got condoms, coups, and lavish condos
50 got me getting ass like I never did
So when I step in the club, hoes love the kid
The boss spending ends
Saying, "Gimme that Benz, 20 inch rims, and four TV's"
The snitch in the precinct saying
"He sell X, he sell techs, and he sell D"

I'm just, I'm just, I'm just the best
Either I'm trippin' off the ecstasy or I could feel the world turnin'
I'm havin' flashbacks, I can feel the shells burnin', comin' up
I was taught never back down that's why I act the way I act now
Hold the mac down, thirty two shots, squeeze til there ain't a shell left
Come with my gun smokin', you can smell death
They get the first laugh, I get the last laugh homie, hit the gas on it
Pull up and mash on 'em, there's a lot of talk in the streets about me
Niggaz know, ain't nothing sweet about me, get back to questions
Like "50, who shot ya? You think it was Preme, Freeze or Tah, Tah?
Nigga, street shit should stay in the street, so, keep it on the low
But everybody who's somebody already know a few words for any nigga
That get hit the fuck up, my advice if you get shot down

Man, I told niggaz not to fuck with me they still push me
Figured they'd get away with it 'cause Tone and Poke pussy
I been gone through static, shot at with automatics, since '90
When Nas came out with Illmatic if Suge was home
Death row would be good for me 'cause Tommy Matola
Ain't shootin' out in the hood wit me, I've been shot nine times
My nigga, that's why I walk funny, hit in the jaw once, why I talk funny
With a Ruger on my hip, I walk the street with no care
Think my grandma's prayers the only reason I'm here
My wrist icy, keep my ears icy, keep my neck icy
That's why you bitch like me, so I'm a heavyweight
How dare these niggaz take me lightly?
I ain't come to make friends and niggaz ain't gotta like me
My own homie said "50, you done lost yo' mind"
'Cause I shoot out in broad day, run and toss my nine
Pain in da ass, fuck you

Nas, niggaz, is this and that
I'm just, I'm just, I'm just the best
Can't find a nigga in the hood, that say, "50 ain't hot", when I drop
I'm sound like Eminem and Kid Rock, play the block with the watch
All rocked the fuck up, jukes me, a week later y'all be shot the fuck up
Born a healthy baby, I wasn't always crazy
This ain't how moma rasied me, this how the hood made me
The D's call me by my government name, I be dumb and shoot up parks
Have niggaz runnin' like "Jesus Comin'", there's wet pillows in prison
Niggaz cry in the dark 'cause if they did in the day
Niggaz would question they heart, so when they come home
The come home, walking that tough walk, talking that rockavalede
Talk'll get you shot in New York, blat, sex, money, murder, I gotta eat
But I ain't tryin' do hard time like pistol P, see, niggaz uptown
Understand me in the street, you niggaz uptown'll stan me in the street

You know the kid ain't gonna follow that bullshit try and stick me Imma let off a full clip
It ain't my fault you done fucked up your re-up
At the dice game who told you put a G up
Everybody mad when their paper don't stack right

Love me in L.A. as soon as I pop in
They come scoop me up in LAX and I hop in
When it comes to bad bitches you know I got them
Some from Long Beach, some from ??, some from Compton
You know a nigga wanna see how Cali girls freak off
After that five hour flight from New York
I start spitting G at a bitch like a pimp man
Tell her meet me at the ???? so we can do our thing
She can bring the lingerie with her I suppose
And we can go from fully dressed to just having no clothes
She can run and tell her best friend bout my sex game
Her best friend could potentially be next man
Listen man, shit changed
I came up from doing my thang
Homey I'm holing, holing, holing

You niggas schemin' on some jewels, you'll get CLAPPED for that
If ya'll niggas want war, I got the MACK for that
Run up with some work, and get your head CRACKED for that

Nigga if a nickel bag sold in the park, I want in on it
The bullshit I'm in right now nigga, I've been on it (yeah)
If I don't eat, nobody eat, code of the street
No surrender, no retreat, my niggas rollin' with heat (woo)
You'll know my stees, I spark trees, under palm trees
Feel a breeze, and fees, in expanded keys
Cop it straight from the bay, tap dance on the yay
Your people make a G day, you ain't rich, you just ok
I take the stand under oath and lie
Before I snitch on my clique, I'll fry
Or watch time go by
Niggas want to steal slabs, and dib or dab
In the posse, who steals from the hands that feed 'em, deserve
to die
 - 2X

You gettin' money nigga (yeah), you dimed out (yeah)
Well 50 Cent is the hottest shit out this (yeah)
You bust your gun nigga (yeah), you on the run nigga (yeah)
You treat a grown man, like he ya son (nigga)
Yo, I ain't the first parolee, to catch his nigga for his rolee
And after being on the street, less than a week
Look, niggas who know me, know I'm up to no good
Man my fan base is spreading like HIV in the hood
Why smack a nigga silly, when I can squeeze the nilly (squeeze
that shit)
A slug'll split a niggas ass, worst than the philly
I stay with the heater, cut the D with Bonita
My wifey kept acting up, so I had to leave her
It hurted when I left, but I knew I didn't need her
If it wasn't for my seed, I wouldn't even hafta see her
She tried to front like she don't need me, she miss me, believe
me
It's that soap opera shit, the bitch watch too much TV
 - 2X

Aight you niggas tryin' to do too much (STOP FRONTIN')
Them little bit of chips you got son, (AIN'T NOTHIN')
I seen you with your whip outside (YOU STUNTIN')
You spent your last on that (YOU AIN'T HOLDIN' NOTHIN')
Rap niggas, they actin' like they ready to flip
When I let off a clip, it ain't a part of the script
Its like tradition, rap niggas, dyin' they whips
So I spent a little chips, to bulletproof my shit
You a 6 coupe nigga, but you gears behind
Nigga yours a 92, mine's a 99
Your not in my league, the ghetto taught me tools to succeed
Shallow up a seed, I'll write it down so you can read
If you've been listening, I know you've been loving what I said
If not you dumb f**k, I just run over your head
 - 2X
{*singing in background until fade*}
If i can't......do it I'ma take ya to the top, Baby I'ma let the champagne bottle pop Baby homie it can't be done
Yo, you know what I want? I want the beat to drop right..now
Niggas be thinkin' I'm crazy right?
You are crazy
I ain't crazy
You are crazy
Atleast I don't think I'm crazy
I think my shit is hot, I think I'm hot
You hot but you crazy
Why they want to? Man, I don't know...
It's the money that, makes shit get ugly
It's the money that, makes these hoes love me
It's the money that, makes niggas want to slug me
Man I thought the money would make it all lovely
Yo, I actually write what I do or see
The felonies from day to day make me say what I say
When I die my art will be worth more than Picasso's, don't cry for me,
Smile for me
And if you see them niggas that wet me, wile' for me
Remember the good times, the chips we stacked
The clips we packed
And all the bricks we cooked from coke to crack
Let my tombstone read "I Tried" and from the start everything I wrote
Was from my heart
So it'll always be number one on my chart
I get sensitive with my shit, don't fuck with my art
Sometimes it sounds like I'm playin' but I'm sayin'
This shit is real, it ain't a game.
They say the good die young, I guess these grimy niggas live a
Long time, sit in fancy whips, sip champaigne and shine, keep your eyes
On yours while I keep my eyes on mine. (Repeat)
First it happened to Stretch then to Pac and Big
I'm convinced it can happen to anybody kid
So I get vest up when I get dressed up
In the hood it's messed up, niggas runnin' 'round shootin' shit up
If it's Dom that you drinkin' fill up my cup
If you got somethin' to doubt me, shut the fuck up
Why do niggas act like they hard when they know they butt?
And gettin' robbed ain't a good time to press ya luck
Duke listen, if you move I'm'a hurt you
You'll get your turn to shine later, patience is a virtue
Right now what you need to do is gimme the cash
Forget about your Boss bein' mad, just save ya ass
Be a good Boy now, go and get your stash
I seen you throw it next to the garbage can like it was trash
Alright run along before I shoot ya ass
I hate to do this to you but I really need this cash.
They say the good die young, I guess these grimy niggas live a
Long time, sit in fancy whips, sip champaigne and shine, keep your eyes
On yours while I keep my eyes on mine. (Repeat)
They say the good die young, I guess these grimy niggas live a
Long time, sit in fancy whips, sip champaigne and shine, keep your eyes
On yours while I keep my eyes on mine. (Repeat)
I know we all gotta go, but I'd hate to go fast
Then again I don't think it'd be fun to stick around and go last
Man listen, if you really really like this shit
Nigga call Steve Stoute and I'll write ya shit
Call him now before I drop for real 'cause after I drop
I'm'a be chargin' ya'll niggas like Forty a pop
To each his own, me? I got it while it was cheap
Typical mentality, I know, I'm straight from the street
1999's the year of the predator, I'm killin' to eat
Niggas'll treat you like a egg, you come to cop you get beat
Gimme your dough, oh, you wore your jewels? what a treat
You're a generous guy
Take 'em off or die
Man, we hurtin' 'round here, ain't nobody slingin' pies
Look around, ain't nobody 'round here fly
Why you 'round here with this shit anyway? huh? you high?
See, you done made the wrong move, kiss your ass goodbye.

The art of getting robbed
This is how we do Brooklyn style, boy
You know what I'm saying?
R.I.P B.I.G, R.I.P P A C
R.I.P niggas that wanna OD
Aiyyo, the bottom line is I'ma crook with a deal
If my record don't sell, I'ma rob and steal
You better recognize, nigga, I'm straight from the street
These industry niggaz starting to look like something to eat
I'll snatch Kim and tell Puff, "You wanna see her again?"
Get your ass down to the nearest ATM
I have dreams of fucking an R an' B bitch
And I'll wake up early and bounce with all your shit
When I apply pressure, son, it ain't even funny
I'm about to stick Bobby for some of that Whitney money
Brian McKnight, I can get that nigga anytime
Have Keith sweating, staring down the barrel from my nine
Since these Harlem World niggaz seem to all be fam
I put the gun to Cardan tell him, "Tell your man
Mason Betha, haha, come up of that watch now
I mean right now"
The only excuse for being broke is being in jail
An entertainer can't make bail if he broke as hell
I'd rob O.D.B. but that'd be a waste of time
Probably have to clap him, run and toss the nine
I'd follow Fox in the drop for four blocks
Plotting to juice her for that rock Kurupt copped
What, Jigga just sold like 4 mil'?
He got something to live for
Don't want no nigga putting four thru that Bentley Coupe door
I'll man handle Mariah like bitch, get on the ground
You ain't with Tommy no more, who gonna protect you now?
I been scheming Tone and Poke since they found me
Steve know not to wear that platinum shit around me
I'm a klepto, nah, for real, son, I'm sick
I'm 'bout to stick Slick Rick for all that old school shit
Right now I'm bent and when I get like this, I don't think
About to make Stevie J take off that tight ass mink
I'll rob Pun without a gun, snatch his piece then run
This nigga weigh 400 pounds, how he gon' catch me, son?
This ain't serious
Being broke can make you delirious
So we rob and steal so our ones can be bigger
50 Cent, how it feel to rob an industry nigga?
This ain't serious
Being broke can make you delirious
So we rob and steal so our ones can be bigger
50 Cent, how it feel to rob an industry nigga?
I'll catch P and Silkk, The Shocker right after the Grammies
And Will Smith and Jada ass down in Miami
Run up on Timberland and Missy with the pound
Like you gimme the cash and you put the hot dog down
I figured it out been robbing Joe before
That's why his ass don't wanna be a playa no more
Mad at you, I'm robbing J.D.
Fuck you, pay me
Had Da Brat with 'em, shoulda had his gat with him
DMX wanna get down, well, you tell, homey
I'm on that Treach shit, I do my 'Dirt All By My Lonely'
I should rob Clue, man, his shit did well
I wanna stick TQ but his shit ain't sell
I hit the studios, take shit and leave
Catch Rae Ghost and RZA for them funny ass rings
Tell Sticky, gimme the cash before I empty three
I'll beat your ass like that white boy on MTV
Canibus wanna battle while I'm sticking them up
Nigga get capped coroners picking him up
Heavy tried to hide his shit, nigga try to stall ya
He said "Why you robbing me
I got 'Nuttin But Love' for ya
Caught Juvenile for his Cash Money piece
Told him I want it all, he said, "Even my gold teeth?"
I caught Blackstreet on a back street in a black jeep
We at a time, get out and take off your shine
Did you ever think that you would be this rich?
Did you ever think that you would have these hits?
Did you ever think that I'd flash the nine
And walk off with your shit like it's mine?
I'ma keep sticking niggas until I'm livid
I'll rob Boys II Men like I'm Michael Bivins
Catch Tyson for half that cash like Robyn Givens
I'm hungry for real, I'm' bout to stick Mister C
That nigga still eating off Big's first LP
I had Busta and the whole Flipmode on the floor
He asked me if I had enough, I told him 'Gimme Some More'
Is you feeling this? Then wait for the sequel
I gotta get Kirk Franklin for robbing God's People
This ain't serious
Being broke can make you delirious
So we rob and steal so our ones can be bigger
50 Cent, how it feel to rob an industry nigga?
For real, yo, you know what I'm saying?
Niggas got to get stuck up, that's just how it goes down
It don't matter if you an industry nigga or a regular nigga
It don't matter, if you got it and I need it I want it
50 Cents ain't fucking around
Track Masters ain't fucking around
Crazy Cat ain't fucking around
The Madd Rapper aint fucking around
So watch your backs, watch your pocket book
Watch your pockets, watch everybody on the train
Watch everybody on the bus
'Cause we gonna get you whether you like it or not
Yo this is 50 cent, yaknawsayin'?
I'm here with my man Whoo Kid
You know how I put it down, nigga
It's not safe around here as soon
As the street lights, G-Unit, nigga
We can't get Money selling weed, we gon' sell coke
Ain't no money sellin' coke, we gon' sell dope
Ain't no money sellin' dope, we gon' sell X
And if niggaz wont by the X, we gon' sell Tecs
My advice for y'all niggaz is stop frontin'
'Cause 50 say pop somethin'
I'm gon' pop somethin', what up?
Don't make me send a nigga to you, 16 shot ruger
Send twelve shots to you, run four in the clip
Get in the whip, it's a wrap
Nah, fuck that
Man, you done hit the nigga twice in the head that's that
Niggaz running with the steel out, now it's time to peel out
50, let me drive
Nah, I got this, nigga, chill out
It'd be nice to get the niggaz ice
Get it, give it back
Just get in the corner store cause it's full of them A-rabs
They blowin' the shit up like it's okay
I got a bomb on my waist, I'm Kamikaze
I dare D's to get next to me
Or a nigga to creep up and put a Tec to me
Yeah, yeah that's it, it's a freestyle
The fuck you want for free?
Fucking Arabs just ran the planes into the fucking building
Coke price went up 10 grand this fucking week

Hats off, to da rich ones who flash and floss
Pour some liquors out to my dogs trapped up north
Reminisce on the deceased who no longer exist
Only wishin' we could bring them back with songs like dis
Old flicks on us chillin' wit da old time click
Holdin' nines, thoughts of death, not our lives we risk
How it use to be, early morn, pumpin' in shifts
Jakes wit pale faces in the night is the scariest
They handcuff me, they knew my government and alias
Various calls were made up for awarin' us
The D's in the marked vans and cabs
In our land, hoodrats get stapped by niggas who forty
Turnin' out young lady's and make them make thoughties
Got them coked out, the hood is bugged out
Thug babies, famous in they strollers
Before they walk they knew the hood talk
It's in the air of New York
So everybody'll pick em up, kissin em up
Treatin' them like they own, in dis hood we call home
Fist fight till we grown and these guns come out
Circle of life, it's kinda deep how we end out.

Yo them niggas that wanted beef before
Don't want no beef no mo
Now that they know who I rep with
QB NIGGA!!!
Who I rep with
QB NIGGA!!! (repeat)

Ya'll niggas better sober up before ya'll speak to me, don't come at me high
Last rapper that raised his voice to me, got japped in da eye
Now if I say I'm gone get you, I'ma get ya
On da strength of da inf, from long range I can hit ya
You find out them niggas who wit ya ain't even wit ya
After da gem stars split ya, you need an MD to stitch ya
Peep how I use words to paint pictures
Peep how I got niggas with bodies askin' me for ten cents to got hit ya
Look my name up in the law book, Curtis Jackson
Known for creatin' action, by rapidly clappin'
Nigga I stay strapped, so much I nickname gats
Got a tech I call Tina, a nine I name Nina
Two niggas went to see Allah afta they seen her
This QB shit, bout to take me to da next level
Next crib, next Benz, next bitch, next bezel.
It's that real.

 (Millennium Thug, Horse, Jungle, Wiz)
Yo, aiyyo, who da fuck wanna war
I got a four four, pierce ya'll niggas jaw
You see me thugged out, iced out, Guinness Stout
Hopin' out the Range wit da gun out

I was gonna hit him with two, I left some for you

I got somethin' for these rap cats, fish held back gats
Scope wit a beam on it, loc put your cream on it
Shine don't scheme on it, I make your dream about it
Forever, whatever whatever get gully
Shots thru your leather and clothe, With your skelly off
Break ya'll clowns off
Yo hollow tips will flood your jacket, I don't give a fuck who you be
Millennium Thug, now who da fuck want it with me.
I mastered the art of slap boxin' niggas in da dark
QB's big man, Horse of the Bravehearts
I'm da Sasquash of rap, collector of gats
Testin' macks at your bulletproof vests and hats.
How bout that, guns bust off, I bust back
When trucks backfire, I bust back
How bout that, stomp a muhfuckin' rib out ur back
Ya'll niggas ain't gangsta rap, ya'll click like Josey and the Pussycats
When we come around da front, stop.
Uh huh, ya'll can't fuck around ya'll get dropped
When guns pop, who's tellin'
Twin barrel nines wavin' and yellin', QB NIGGA WHAT
Two-time felon, straight to da melon, straight to da dome
Send a nigga back, get da shells, go straight home
Never slip, my +Ill Will+ to survive is so deep
Can't sleep, cousin to death, makes me weak
Pullin' triggers at my shadow, Bravehearts pop up
Wiz, Jungle and Horse shot your block up.

Them niggas that wanted war before
Don't want no war no mo
Now that they know who I rep wit
QB NIGGA!!
Who I rep wit
QB NIGGA!! (repeat)



You think about money when you think about me huh,
That's what my ex, my ex you don't want to be her,
She used to have the beemer, now she own a sneaker,
I had her eating lobster now she eating pizza,
I think about Easter when I think about Keyshia,
Shorty stay fly that's why I keep her,
Round like the reefer, brown Mona Lisa,
She good if I leave her she got her own visa,

Fell in love with a bitch walked away with one leg,
She ain't even have to run to get away with the bread,
That's some fucked up shit
Think about that kid,
I'm thinking what this bitch thinking when she take me to court,
I pay my child support, what the fuck she want,
This relationship, shit its too much for me,
I wanna fuck your friends and live comfortably
She wanna shine and blow minds on shopping sprees,
She should have what she wants just not for me,
I'm thinking bout my future she part of my past,
She don't care bout me she just want some cash,
I'm thinking damn girl, we used to be friends,
How did sh-t become all about ends

Do you think about me?

I know you think about me,

Just a lil' bit

Think all I do is rap, then you don't know me good
Have Smurf hangin out the sun roof to light up your hood, man

And I move with the Doublemint Twins and two macs
And leave you flat your back
BRRAT
Take that


I gotta half a mil deal with no diploma
Ice so blind it give your ass glaucoma
Its hard to live, but its easy to die
So I'm going through life lookin death in the eye
These rappers ain't gun slingers
They R&B; singers
G-Unit, come thru with some guerilla niggas
Minimum wage ain't gonna pay the rent
Cause the seats in the coupe got the Fendi print
And this shit right here for the listeners pleasure
I'm still on the strip with the fifth and my ever
Its T-O-N-Y
Stay with a semi
Milk your crack spot - till the shit be bone dry
You think you pump hard? Nigga I pump harder
My phone ring so much, I walk around with the charger
When the D's come around, I'ma swallow my crack
Shit the work out later, and hit 'em with that
If it's a direct sale

Tryin to push the new Range cause they changed the grille
Look nigga we icey thugs

And you know I love the way you make the bed rock
Take me to extasy without taking Extasy

When I first met her
I did anything to get her (what?)
Paid all her bills and filled the 'fridgerator (uh huh)
Reminiscin' on late nights when I try to lay up
but couldn't get off cause your baby would stay up
She even crashed the whip tryin' to switch in the third lane
That's when I realized this bitch was a bird brain
A pigeon writin' her baby pops in the box in the prison
Sing-sing is where he biddin'
She in the Gucci tights and Findi high heals
Baby wipes and cans of Infamil
Moter bike and grams of fish scale
It's a 9 to 5 niggas with no frills
Turnin' young niggas with princables to old men with debts
And all the prank calls was death threats that bitch had the best sex
All across the globe and the bitch head game was out of control

Girl you know I like it when you climb on top
Love muscles feel tighter than a headlock
And you know I love the way you make the bed rock
Take me to extasy without taking Extasy

I'm wonderin' when I'm gone if you'll miss me (miss me)
or do you miss the Don Perion and the Cristy
I'm fuckin' with you

Later on I'm feelin' your ass and feelin' your thighs (come here baby)
Sweet heart your book smart and street smart (uh huh)

The Lords blessin' makes me wiser as the world's turnin'
My tongue touch the right spot have your toes curlin'
Whether we're just kickin' it or sexin' (uh huh) I'm a pro baby girl I spit game to perfection (Yeah)
So when niggas make mistakes I correct them and
When niggas get out of line I check them man

Girl you know I like it when you climb on top
Love muscles feel tighter than a headlock

Take me to extasy without taking Extasy

Now, what you think you chump me, if I let you bump me
When I'm about to make a mill, faster than you make a G, ha ha
I know I lie, it's a habit, I vow to clean the city like the mayor
And in the crack game, I'm a franchise player
Niggas be thinkin' I be out to lunch with mines
Then in crunch time, I start hittin' 'em hard with punch lines
You cats got to be sick to think 50 can't spit
Better check my batting average, I always make hits
My flows leave these rap cats ketro, ketro all across the metro, metro
Plus I pack a cannon, up under my marple cannon
They fake, they look like money but ain't worth half the cake
Have me runnin' from Jake, in a GS with bad brakes
They want to knock me take for Christ sakes
50 Cent, let's see if homicide trace this
I change places to prevent catchin' the cases
Races in the faces, hall at you laces
This is a hit, let's see if homicide trace this

Yo son, remember them fake playas
Who try to play us at The Shark Club in Vegas
Had them tight linen blazers and beat up gators
Lookin' like last year's playas, pause
Yeah, I could tell they dough was low
When we came through the do'
I copped a case of Cristal and copped one bottle of Mo
From the looking through face and the bulge in his waist, he holdin'
Yeah he's packin', I can see his rack
The one in the middle, he a big man, I dealt with him son
Yeah, so I expect look like they ain't had a run since ' 81
They ain't here on a hunt for food
So they could catch you, some cash and expensive jewels
I'm gonna crash 'em with this bottle if he move
I ain't the one son, my shit ain't come easy
It won't go easy, believe me
I change places to prevent catchin' the cases
Races in the faces, hall at you laces
This is a hit, let's see if homicide trace this

Lloyd Banks in the house, bad news
Tony Yayo in the house, bad news
50 cent in the house, bad news whenever 50 around its bad news
Tray pound's in the house, bad news
40 Kal's in the house, bad news
I got a knife in the house, bad news whenever 50 around its bad news

I get little (?) mad cause I'm flossin' bad
I ain't a wrestler, but I'll put your bitch the Boston crab
I talk money cause it costs to brag
Round here bitches walk round here at the horse's head (?)
Rap it get your face stuck on them bricks
I don't really like to exercise but I'll push up on a bitch
y'all sweet like 99 bananas
That's why I got 99 niggaz wit 99 hammers
They all want a nigga to stop
Cause I rap slick enough to slip the ring off of Vivica Fox
I'm just a playa that found out where the cokes know
That's why I'mma be around longer than the Oprah show
You and your man y'all both should know
That all it takes is a finger to send you where the ghosts go
Shit I been hated since the 5th grade
that's why my best friend the tray pound, a ice pick, and a switch blade

I don't like you, you don't like me
Its not likely that we'll ever be friends
Why pretend? (Ma, Banks' back at it again)
I don't like you, you don't like me
Its not likely that we'll ever be friends
Why pretend? (Ma, Tony's back at it again)

Rule number one pick a target and study him for weeks
See where they rest at and lay with their peeps
Now you got the drop, know their daily routine
So the 2nd rule please leave the crime scene please
3rd rule pick a day, 4th rule pick a time
5th rule pick a fifth, 6th rule pick a nine
And the seventh rule make sure your sidearm sweet
So when the shootout you leave him 6 feet deep
8th meet in a fast car with disguise
Use a ski mask with shades on your eyes
9th rule don't say shit cause Po-Po listen
Fuck around you end up being stuck in the system
And the 10th rule don't put a tag on a broken heart
Just put a toe-tag on your mark
And rule number 11, you caught a body but you not a legend
You better watch where you heading

I don't like you, you don't like me
Its not likely that we'll ever be friends
Why pretend? (Ma, 50's back at it again)
I don't like you, you don't like me
Its not likely that we'll ever be friends
Why pretend? (Ma, 50's back at it again)

Go ahead go against me I'll hurt your feelings
Stones in my cross the size of your earrings
My confidence level's high nigga can't tell
Licking my lips at your bitch like I'm L.L.
I smile like a nigga in jail receiving mail
Better yet like nigga Bookers that made bail
From day one I came in the game they said I was hot
They got scared, "Cent got money" and I got shot
You so much pressure on me when you compare me to Pac
I'm just a new kid, I can't help that I'm hot
What little niggaz say to 50 cent don't matter
I'll fire shots at the ship and watch the seas scatter
my enemies never turn into friends, my friends turn into enemies
you scared then get the fuck around me
Record execs, no not the (?) on my check
I come through with my knife cause I'm a pain your neck (YEAH!)

I don't like you, you don't like me
Its not likely that we'll ever be friends
Why pretend? (Ma, 50's back at it again)
I don't like you, you don't like me
Its not likely that we'll ever be friends
Why pretend? (Ma, 50's back at it again)
Lloyd Banks in the house, bad news
Tony Yayo in the house, bad news

Tray pound's in the house, bad news
40 Kal's in the house, bad news
I got a knife in the house, bad news whenever 50 around its bad news
Yo, niggas be askin' me "yo 50 who you got beef wit?"
I'm a tell why all niggas who I got beef wit
I got beef wit any nigga I can't make no money wit
If I can't make no money wit you, fuck you nigga
G-Unit nigga, that's whats up cause I said that's whats up

I get money, money I got
So its a 100 grams or better when I'm going to cop
I never hold the toaster cause I use my little soldier
And my down bitch as a holster, like I'm supposed to
Heavy pistol sales for living
My gun rip through lungs and tear through tissue
While I'm out for the ends, you out for a rep
That's the same thing that have yo mama in a black dress
See me in a black lex, hard-top
My mink drop-top, fresh out the carlot
I got the gift of raw pugilist speeches
So I'm goin' sell like the box office features
Niggas in the hood can't see G-UNIT!
But deep in they heart they want to be G-UNIT!
Cause we got them three B's benzes, burners and bitches
And plus we on the road to the riches

You can say what you want about me
As long as you don't get in the way of my money
Cause all that talking shit to me played out
Nigga keep bumping your gums you get laid out

Lately I been going through a phase
Hope they ain't tap the phones
Cause we got pumps the size of saxophones
Therefore I'm on the move with the squad
I'm stingy as ever, known to trick fast food on a broad
Picture me putting jewels on a broad
I'd rather put shoes on the car
A pool in the yard
You don't really want to fool with the god
Nigga my front line long enough to fill two boulevards
In this game, you only make it far if you loyal
And if you grew up with your mother and your father you spoiled
Why swing, you gotta be strapped to get rid of me
Ill leave you in water like the statute of liberty
Tryin' to be cool
Blowin' green that strong enough to make a white boy open fire on a school
Keep rappin' for your hood, I'm rappin' for Benzes
And long assault rifles with straps on the lenses


Why all niggas gotta learn from me (Yeah!)
What I learned from Gotta Rock and Spank G
Why all niggas gotta learn from me (Yeah!)
What I learned from watching Brucie be
Look, I shot the sheriff
And nigga if you get too close yo punk ass getting shot
Here's the plan, I'm a keep stackin' my ends
Till I'm on airplane seats in the Maybach Benz
I'm all about the chips
I done took them trips
22's on the 6
26 on the bricks
And them out of town niggas, I'm chargin' why'all more
I tap dance on the shit I ain't servin' it raw
You sell smoke, look nigga I got what you need
But it ain't goin' cheap I got mouths to feed
Niggas always sayin' damn 50 you bugged
Cause I got hoes giving niggas the date rape drug
Gimme his watch and his chain
We not the same, he a lame
He want pussy I'm bout my money man
Crap table in Vegas had his bitch on my dick
Threw a 7 so many times they thought the dice was fixed
Yo its 50, when your mind-frame change and start to rearrange
I'll see you another day motherfucker it's 50
Shots till your heart drop and freeze up, ease up motherfucker


If a bitch don't like me
somethin's wrong with the bitch...(fuck that bitch)

Why...oh why...why..you wanna fuck with me now?

Yo Dave, that shit come with the game baby, the money, you know,
thats how this shit works, you know?
they supposed to love me now baby,
I'm hot now baby, I'm doin' it now.
Chorus (Dave Hollister singing)
Girl, what makes you wanna fuck with me now?
I've been wantin' to fuck wit' you for quite a while
is the money makin' you wanna fuck with me?
Whoa...if money's gonna make me slam these hoes..then alright.

Whattup Shorty, I ain't seen you in many moons,
talk to me, how's life been treatin' you? good I hope, y
ou got a smile that only a fool would forget
and a figure that'll leave a nigga droolin' and shit
there I was, kickin' my game
pickin' her brain
buggin' 'cause a while back I met this bitch on the train
she wasn't feelin' me, I pulled up, she wouldn't talk from the whip
Uptown girl, she feel like thats some chickenhead shit
but on the sidewalk we ain't play games
we exchanged numbers and names
I went back to the Range
I heard her Girlfriend whisperin' "I know that nigga, he rich"
she think I got six whips 'cause me and my Man switch
anyway, her name is CeCe
she said she go to BMCC
push a '98 328 with chrome BB's
she said she seen me in the Onyx video on TV
she liked my part the best, man, this bitch is tryin' to G me.
Chorus

It's hard as Hell to find a Girl thats really down for ya
type that'll hold down the Tre pound for ya
they into diamonds now, to Hell with pearls
these trick niggas fucked up, they done gave 'em the World
Hey Shorty, why you like me? huh? you like the way I spit?
oh, I hit your girlfriend, she told you 'bout the dick?
nah for real, am I the type that you wanna roll wit'?
platinum iced out, got rid of that gold shit
I love my lifestyle, you too, you love it
that I could blow Twenty Thousand and think nothin' of it
know you wouldn't fuck with me if I had no ends
probably wouldn't fuck in the whip if it wasn't a Benz
I guess life looks different through them Shanel tints
Man, I don't care if these hoes love me or not
long as I rhyme hot I'm gettin' head in my drop
it goes on and on and on and it don't stop.
Chorus

One thing you can always count on is change
and a rich nigga to come put shit in the game
had a 4.0 then Jigga made you trade your Range
would've felt broke if you couldn't get your change
now it's hard to find us or stay behind us
while we on the 900 double R Hondas
watch the cats who flip bricks recline in the latest whips
while Penetentiaries stay packed with cats who sling packs
all these hoes ain't Madonna fans but all across the World
you can find a material Girl
I sip Dom 'till I earl
take 'em two at a time
quick I get in they mind
have 'em thinkin' they mine
bust off then tell 'em "Bust a Uey, on mo' time"
I'm like the reason ya'll niggas can't eat this year
got your bitch breakin' her neck to peep this here
c'mon..uh huh...c'mon.
Chorus 2x

Fuck you bitch! leave me alone, walk on...get the fuck on...

Yo, Shorty..tell your friends ya'll ain't fuckin' with us..aww
man...look...he ain't mean that shit..
c'mon thats just records..niggas is playin'..
we wasn't serious and shit..
Trackmasters, 99 shit
Huh uh, huh uh, yea

Slow dough, is better than no dough (fa sho)
Get caught talking to popo (what you say to him son?)
They hit you with the fofo (blaow, that's right)
My niggas is loco (loco)
Yo to diss me that's a no-no (no-no)
Y'all niggas is so-so (so-so)
That's why you ain't got no dough (broke ass niggas)
Put me through any test I bet ya I'll pass cause I'm a cheater
Broke niggas, smoke niggas, rich niggas smoke Cohiba's
My team been puffing chiba and packing heaters since the days of shell toe Adidas
And ain't shit come between us
Look I'm winning now and I'ma keep on winning
I see with you ain't nothing changed same ginen same linen
Fuck the don shit, nigga I'm an armed convict
I live wild beat cases before a trial
Grand jury style I'm foul
You wondering why I don't smile
I'm schemeing to stick you up now
Son I be the first to blast the gun, the last to run
While you hit the pavement son I mash you, ugh
If you don't know you better go and ask someone
50 Cent is my symbol and my name
Symbolizing the change that I'm bringing to this game
Things'll never be the same (never the same baby)

Yo nowadays niggas talk like they wanna get shot
Like I won't grab the glock and run up in your spot
Six double O drop I'll put two in your knot
And stick around and get every motherfucking thing you've got
Here I stand on the alley on godrule
Same spot where rob got shot
The block's high
Warrent squad flashing my mug shot
Everybody know I'm loco, kill the popo, blast the fo fo, rode dolo
Rock solo, I should be old T on the low yo
Pump the six and push the volvo
I hear they go kuku and go puff loco
I sell llelo and price up and down like yo yo
But keep that on the low do, nobody's supposed to know, yo
I make 16 hundred off of every ho do
Fucking with the cash flow that'll get you blast yo (haha)
I always get the last laugh yo

I rap a muthafucking house around my my wrist for wreck
While you niggas race neck to neck
While niggas who live from cheque to tech
I ain't even going to front I ain't working with a full deck
Life in the hood so hard I done lost some of my cards
Instead of praying before I sleep I put my hands on my heat
As soon as I start dreaming I'm right back on the street
Any nigga in this game flowing they think they can see me
Gotta be, fucked up in the head and smoking hemee
Believe me if you thought like me you could be me
But you ain't been through what I been through and this shit ain't that easy (one)

 (You should be here) jeeps i got some more shit I stay wit some hoes 'cause i use the tools i keep a benz i keep some rims and i stay wit some jewels (You should be here) Im internationally known everybody know me way down in Magnolia they feelin me (You should be here) whoodie But you can catch me in Houston wit Bun and Pimp Cee or in Miami wit Luke in V.I.P (Raphael Sadiqq sings)
Man we gotta go get something to eat man
I'm hungry as a motherfucker
Hey yo man, damn what's taking homie so long son?
50, calm down, here he come
What the fuck!?
Son, pull up! pull up!
Many men, wish death upon me
Blood in my eye dog and I can't see
I'm trying to be what I'm destined to be
And niggas trying to take my life away
I put a hole in nigga for fucking with me
My back on the wall, now you gon' see
Better watch how you talk, when you talk about me
'Cause I'll come and take your life away
Many men, many, many, many, many men
Wish death 'pon me
Lord I don't cry no more
Don't look to the sky no more
Have mercy on me
Now these pussy niggas putting money on my head
Go on and get your refund motherfucker, I ain't dead
I'm the diamond in the dirt, that ain't been found
I'm the underground king and I ain't been crowned
When I rhyme, something special happen every time
I'm the greatest, something like Ali in his prime
I walk the block with the bundles
I've been knocked on the humble
Swing the ox when I rumble
Show your ass what my gun do
Got a temper nigga, go 'head, lose your head
Turn your back on me, get clapped and lose your legs
I walk around gun on waist, chip on my shoulder
Till I bust a clip in your face, pussy, this beef ain't over
Many men, many, many, many, many men
Wish death 'pon me
Lord I don't cry no more
Don't look to the sky no more
Have mercy on me
Have mercy on my soul
Somewhere my heart turned cold
Have mercy on many men
Many, many, many, many men
Wish death upon me
Sunny days wouldn't be special, if it wasn't for rain
Joy wouldn't feel so good, if it wasn't for pain
Death gotta be easy, 'cause life is hard
It'll leave you physically, mentally, and emotionally scarred
This if for my niggas on the block, twisting trees and cigars
For the niggas on lock, doing life behind bars
I don't see only god can judge me, 'cause I see things clear
Quick these crackers will give my black ass a hundred years
I'm like Paulie in Goodfellas, you can call me the Don
Like Malcolm by any means, with my gun in my palm
Slim switched sides on me, let niggas ride on me
I thought we was cool, why you want me to die homie?
Many men, many, many, many, many men
Wish death 'pon me
Lord I don't cry no more
Don't look to the sky no more
Have mercy on me
Have mercy on my soul
Somewhere my heart turned cold
Have mercy on many men
Many, many, many, many men
Wish death upon me
Every night I talk to god, but he don't say nothing back
I know he protecting me, but I still stay with my gat
In my nightmares, niggas keep pulling techs on me
Psych says some bitch dumb, put a hex on me
The feds didn't know much, when Pac got shot
I got a kite from the pens that told me, Tuck got knocked
I ain't gonna spell it out for you motherfuckers all the time
Are you illiterate nigga? You can't read between the lines
In the bible it says, what goes around, comes around
Almost shot me, three weeks later he got shot down
Now it's clear that I'm here, for a real reason
'Cause he got hit like I got hit, but he ain't fucking breathing
Many men, many, many, many, many men
Wish death 'pon me
Lord I don't cry no more
Don't look to the sky no more
Have mercy on me
Have mercy on my soul
Somewhere my heart turned cold
Have mercy on many men
Many, many, many, many men
Wish death upon me
I'm on parole, I used to be on probation
I'm with my gun I get full corporation
I tell you "take it off" no hesitation
Nigga you play around, I lay you down
That's how it's goin' down
Don't play wit' me, I don't have patients
My headachin', and I need my medication
Niggas be hatin', they don't know what they facin'
Nigga you play around, I lay you down
That's how it's goin' down
I be in court throwin' signs like I'm a mason
Nigga witness against me, I'm a erase 'em
If they try an runaway, I'm a chase 'em
Now with the pound, and I'm a lay 'em down
That's how it's goin' down

Better watch how you talk
Better watch where you walk
On the streets of New York
That's how we get down
22's on the jeep
Somethin' deep in the seat
When we creep wit the heat
That's how we get down
Wise men listen and laugh while fools talk
Stick up kids don't live long in New York
Fuck around and catch the wrong jukes on the street
Get caught slippin', then get hit wit' like three
In every hood in the US, I'm that nigga they feelin'
Rap full of good guys, 50 Cent is the villain
I play the bar with 8 bottles all night gettin' right
Teachin' the hood rats what Cristal taste like
I put 60 on wrist, 12 on my fist, 100 on my neck
We in the hood nigga schemin', what you expect?
My S on 22's leave ya hos confused
On the track ready to choose, like "Daddy we want you"
My love live ain't change, the shorties still hug me
Bullet wound in my face, and bitches still love me
Now Nelly told you how them country boys talk
I came to teach you how we put it down in New York
That's how we get down

In the city, a young buck'll tell you how the mac spit
O.G. give 'em the word, you gonna get yo' ass hit
I don't know why niggas like to talk bad about me
I'm the richest nigga they know without a G.E.D.
Man it could be the money, it could be the ice
It could be they'd like to be me and can't live my life
You should here they be sayin' man "50 be flippin'"
"Shot my man over 7 grams, that nigga be trippin'"
I know death is promised, I don't fear gettin' murked
It's when a nigga half-way killa ya homie, it hurts
Now we can hit the club and get it crunked
Or you could start some shit, and I could hit you with
The pump, you can have it how you want
But I know you like my style (Uh-Huh)
Ya like how I break it down, want to get rich?
I'll show you how, take this pack, pump these pieces
That's how we get down


Look If you ain't worth a mil, you ain't far from broke
Got anought heart to sell weed but you scared of dope
I wouldn't snitch on my peoples if the feds grabbed me
Yo ass would hit more notes than Ron Isley
I wouldn't rhyme about Rolleys if I had no watch
Wouldnt write about crack if I ain't had no spot
You talk six coupe shit you only pushing a trey
Got bitches shutting you down in the C.L.K
For cats like you, crime don't pay
You just linger in the hood, them niggaz blow you away
You the type to get paper when I'm locked up, get yo jewels rocked up
Then have to tuck em in when I pop up
Niggaz in the hood sayin "50's Grimy"
Cause they hit me wit Kosami and now they can't find me
If you see it how I see it, my watch is yo whip
And I can cop anotha one afta each assist

These straight busters kept-in, kept-in my Benz, hop-in the end's,
Watch the twenty two spin , my hoe's they perfect ten
I got shot up but I got up and I'm back at it again,
Motherfuckers they thought I would'nt win, pretend to be friends,
At first you fail, try, try, try, try again,

You love it, admit it, you like it, I live it, its Shady,
Aftermath in your ass bitch, if its not a classic,

Stop and get your ass kicked, bastered, your misses get drastic,

I got places to go, I got people to see,
The penitentiary, ain't the place for me,

Picture me starting shit, picture me busting my gat,
Picture police man dey ain't gotta picture of that,
Picture me being broke, picture me smokin' a sack,
Picture me comin' up, picture me rich from rap,
Picture me blowin' up, now picture me going back,
To my momma basement to live, shit, picture that,
Where I'm from its a fact, you gotta watch your back,
You wear a vest without a gat, you's a target jack,
Hastle hard, money stack, sell that dope, sell that crack,
Sell that pack, sell that gat, sell that pussy, crew are back,

Or matter a fact I might be in Detroit,

You know for one of them en-joints and shit,

Ya heard, I got place to go man,
You know, Shady aftermath,
We finished our print money,
Puttin' our faces on this motherfuckin' bill thug shit,

Ain't seem to be doing much
Go, go, go, go go, go, go, shawty
It's your birthday
We gon' party like it's yo birthday
We gon' sip Bacardi like it's your birthday
And you know we don't give a fuck
It's not your birthday!
You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub

So come give me a hug if you into to getting rubbed
You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub
Look mami I got the X if you into taking drugs
I'm into having sex, I ain't into making love
So come give me a hug if you into to getting rubbed
When I pull out up front, you see the Benz on dubs
When I roll twenty deep, it's twenty knives in the club
Niggas heard I fuck with Dre, now they want to show me love
When you sell like Eminem, and the hoes they want to fuck
But homie ain't nothing change hold down, G's up
I see Xzibit in the Cutt that nigga roll that weed up
If you watch how I move you'll mistake me for a player or pimp
Been hit wit a few shells but I don't walk wit a limp
In the hood then the ladies saying "50 you hot"
They like me, I want them to love me like they love 'Pac
But holla in New York them niggas'll tell ya I'm loco
And the plan is to put the rap game in a choke hold
I'm feelin' focused man, my money on my mind
I got a mill out the deal and I'm still on the grind
Now shawty said she feeling my style, she feeling my flow
Her girlfriend want to get bi and they ready to go
You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub
Look mami I got the X if you into taking drugs
I'm into having sex, I ain't into making love
So come give me a hug if you into to getting rubbed
You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub
Look mami I got the X if you into taking drugs
I'm into having sex, I ain't into making love
So come give me a hug if you into to getting rubbed
My flow, my show brought me the dough
That bought me all my fancy things
My crib, my cars, my pools, my jewels
Look, nigga, I came up and I ain't changed
And you should love it, way more then you hate it
Nigga you mad? I thought that you'd be happy I made it
I'm that cat by the bar toasting to the good life
You that fagot ass nigga trying to pull me back right?
When my junk get to pumping in the club it's on
I wink my eye at ya bitch, if she smiles she gone
If the roof on fire, let the motherfucker burn
If you talking bout money homie, I ain't concerned
I'm a tell you what Banks told me cause go 'head switch the style up
If the niggas hate then let 'em hate
Watch the money pile up
Or we go upside there wit a bottle of bub
You know where we fucking be
You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub
Look mami I got the X if you into taking drugs
I'm into having sex, I ain't into making love
So come give me a hug if you into to getting rubbed
You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub
Look mami I got the X if you into taking drugs
I'm into having sex, I ain't into making love
So come give me a hug if you into to getting rubbed
Don't try to act like you ain't know where we been either, nigga
In the club all the time, nigga, so it's a problem pop off, nigga, G-Unit!

It's best you be a gentleman
and you watch what you say (bwahh nigga take that)
Or Jesus Christ can't save you once you go gangsta, friend

Yo, no more freestyles and verses killin' Sticky and Ja
I've movin' on now, I got bigger fish to fry
Since 'How to Rob' a lot of niggas been naming names
Monkey see monkey do, I done changed the game
Still niggas acting like I don't get down or something
Like I ain't the next nigga to wear the crown or something
You gonna talk about your chips till we run in your crib
And you gone ask dumb questions like "Can I Live?"
Look, If I shoot you, I'm famous
If you shoot me your brainless, you said it yourself
I'm slick enough to twist your lines and send them back at you
Swift enough to snatch the mack and pop that at you
Take it personal see if I won't send you to hell
I've done told Ton and Pok? they better have my bail
But if its over a mil don't put the crib up dun
Cause if 50 get free nigga, 50 gonna run
 2x
It's best you be a gentleman
and you watch what you say (bwahh bwahh, nigga take that)
Or Jesus Christ can't save you once you go gangsta, friend


Look I'm supposed to be cocky, I ain't a po' no mo'
I ain't gotta steal from the corna' store no mo'
Got my own crib, I ain't sleepin' on the flo' no mo'
Bouncers don't try to play me at the do' no mo'
But when they see me they say search him
"He might have the nine
He might shoot this motherfucker up like Shyne"
It's been a while since a new nigga came tight like this
Ya man, he aight, but he ain't quite like this
Niggas is feelin' it
The Benz pullin up on the set (uh huh)
Me jumpin out 30 tho on my neck (uh huh uh huh)
And since you said it was nothin' to sweat (what)
That you was outta line so here's what you get
A verbal ass kickin'
Jesus Christ sent me to test ya
Let's see how see how he act's under pressure
Till Makaveli returns it's 'All Eyez On Me'
Till the feds build up cases and find pie's on me
 2x
It's best you be a gentleman
and you watch what you say (bwahh bwahh bwahh, bwahh nigga take that)
Or Jesus Christ can't save you once you go gangsta, friend

It's gangsta, 2000 shit

A hour later have that ass up in the Ramada

How it feels to be with a P-I-M-P
Roll in the Benz with me, you could watch TV
From the backseat of my V, I'm a P-I-M-P
Girl, we could pop some champagne and we could have a ball
We could toast to the good life, girl, we could have it all
We could really splurge, girl, and tear up the mall
If ever you needed someone I'm the one you should call
I'll be there to pick you up if ever you should fall
If you got problems I can solve 'em, they big or they small
That other nigga you be with ain't 'bout shit

She got on Payless; me? I got on gator shoes
I'm shopping for chinchillas in the summer, they cheaper
Man, this ho you can have her, when I'm done I ain't gon' keep her
Man, bitches come and go, every nigga pimping know
You saying it's secret, but you ain't gotta keep it on the low
Bitch, choose with me, I'll have you stripping in the street
Put my other hoes down, you get your ass beat

Get your ho out of pocket, I'll put a charge on a bitch
Cause I need 4 TVs and AMGs for the six

While you in your bubble bath I'll come wash on your back
When you puttin on your lotion I can help you with that
I sit and think of things to say that may make you smile
Or give you gifts from my heart to reflect my style
Or slang I use when we build may change how you talk
And if I'm focused while I'm strokin I could change how you walk
There's a swagger that you calm but when you come from New York
I'm a hustler I just hustle in the things that I bought
Separate me from the rest, I feel like I'm the best
If there's a price to pay for feelin you I pay that twice
I'm as ghetto as it gets girl you know that's right
I ain't got nothin to hide baby I tell you my secrets

Thug niggas in the street saying I'm sunning you

People say chill, but still I do, what I wanna do

And if I don't feel a nigga, I don't get on his shit
Y'all can love me, or hate me, or suck my dick
I like my hoes just like Summer, no class
And niggas working so hard, and getting no ass
Why y'all niggas acting like, it's all ill in y'all square
Motherfucker you ain't know that it's a hood everywhere
Me and 50 vandal, no we always run scandal
Weak niggas, have us lighting up candles

Bitches I don't love no of 'em, the guns I'm running 'em
Punk niggas I'm sunning 'em, every chance I get
Man I know niggas is a trip, so I save all my grip
For these babies faggots flippin', dial 1-800-TIPS
Force me to bury the bricks, and the whips and take trips
Every word that come out of my mouth, I mean it, you could eat
'Cause when I stick you, you gon' cough it up like you bulimic
I'm no magician, but I could make, somethin' outta nothin'
Like turn an empty block, into a crack spot that's pumping

How you gonna take this? Like a man or a bitch?
You gon' get it on nigga or you gon' snitch?
I represent niggas in the hood gettin' rich
Man, I stack chips and I unload clips
After 3 summers in the joint I thought life was hard
Some niggas started fightin', some niggas found God
You know me, started sellin' leek in the yard
Yo, I ran into niggas who used to have Hummers big as Hell
In the joint wearin' '86 numbers damn Dog, you been in here that long?
You could think that but say that and yo' ass is dead wrong
A convoy is only three words, "Yo whattup"
You ain't gotta work out to leave this bitch cut up
Let a nigga find out you on some goin' home shit
And you tryin' to bounce without payin' a loan, shit
Some niggas beat cases on the strength of they cream
After the witnesses disappeared on the strength of they team
I'm hard as Hell to get along wit' so it never fails
A nigga I got beef with end up in the same jail
He had a L rolled in bible paper blowin' the lye
I sent him a little kite just to be blowin' his high
And when I shot you in New York why would I box you now?
If I catch you in the yard I'ma ox you down
Niggas you think is real really can't hold they own
I'll have 'em on some E.T. shit tryin' to phone home
In here a gem star is like a Nine Milly chrome
It's similar, in fact they'll both split ya dome
Scars are souvenirs, niggas always take 'em home.
You got blown over the jack?

Your Man ran when you got clapped?

Rockin' a vest with no gat?

You only a thug when you rap?

Niggas jocked you for your track?

You ran to other thugs to get it back?

Niggas ran off with your packs?

If you ain't bustin' ya gat

You'd call me an Animal if you seen me livin' on lock
I stay in a box cats be shook when I'm visitin' pop-ulation
When I walk by, niggas like, "Fifty don't play Son"
Yeah, somethin' really wrong with that nigga
Max out, I'm goin' straight for the glock
Bust a u-turn, I'm goin' straight to the block
The things that'll happen if niggas say I can't eat
Down goes the window, out goes the heat
I'll make the whole block look like a fuckin' track meet
Some get it in the leg, some get it in the back
Some get it in the foot, bleed all over their air max
Nigga pump my packs or pay poor tax
It's extortion, it happens in the hood often
Claim more lives than choices, free abortions
Rich Nice says I got a problem with the dice
'Cause I put the title to the Benz on the line twice
I rock shit 'cause I stay on that block shit
That 9mm Ruger to your knot shit
See the difference is I'm real and you not, kid
I still stash crack money in my sock, shit
Y'all niggas wanna pop shit? I pop clips
Leave with your blood on my mink in the drop Six
Guiliani and Pataki can't stop this
Since '86 my whole clique pop Criss.
You got blown over the jack?

Your Man ran when you got clapped?

Rockin' a vest with no gat?

You only a thug when you rap?

Niggas jocked you for your track?

You ran to other thugs to get it back?

Niggas ran off with your packs?

Live in trife, and that's real
Talkin shit on us, that's like pullin out a knife and don't kill

A pimp ain't a pimp with no motherfuckin hoes [hoes]
A hustla ain't a hustla with no motherfuckin dough [dough]
A thug ain't a thug if his gun don't smoke [smoke]
A playa ain't a playa if his ass dead broke [broke]

You done got your paper, now its time I get mines
Except the serve and everything'll be fine

Aiyyo, whattup whattup, man
This is what y'all niggaz is workin' wit' for 22 cents a gram?
Man, when I come up in here, treat me like I'm fam
I could go Uptown and get this shit for 16 cents a gram
Bottom line is, man, I gotta cop and go
I got a spot and I can't afford to stop the flow
Poppi, what the fuck is the matter wit' ya Man?
Standin' against the wall with a gun in his hand
I ain't on no funny shit I'm on some get this money shit
Every four days in PA I move another brick
According to the DA, I sold dope in VA
My crew stay in Queens but my plates say VA
I'll show you where I rest at, it ain't hard to find me
Let me buy a brick and get the other on cossimy

I know, don't remind me
If I catch another case I'ma kill Guiliani
It ain't even safe to sell a pack at night
Got task ridin' 'round the projects on Mountain Bikes
NY ain't the same, it's OT playa
You can go and cop coke from the corner Bodega
Hit the highway and take it to a town near you
And get that money man, get that money man
NY ain't the same, it's OT playa
You can go and cop coke from the corner Bodega
Hit the highway and take it to a town near you
And get that money man, get that money man
Now, if you come to 1 3 4 and I'm not around
That means I copped and I went outta town
You motherfuckers know how I get down
 G-UNIT! I started my own gang
 G-UNIT!
 G-UNIT! I started my own gang
 G-UNIT!
It's a fact homie, eagles don't fly in flocks
But the eagles I got own sixteen shots
Like beefin', homie I ain't sayin' a word
I'll run up on your punk ass squeezing the bird
Now what New York niggas know about country grammar
Not much, but we know how to bang them hammers
When I pull out that thing, you better break yourself
Or win a trip to ICU, and you can take yourself
If you lucky motherfucker, I'm solider I told ya
Push ya shit back, put my knife through ya six pack
Gat bust, adrenaline rush, blowin' the dust
Five point O, burnin' the cluth, while I'm burnin' the dutch
You thought them other niggas was hot, I'm turnin' it up
This the blueprint, nigga are you learnin' or what
You done told me you respect me, now tell me I'm the nicest
Admit it nigga, I'm a mid-life crisis
 G-UNIT! I started my own gang

 G-UNIT! I started my own gang

It's like niggas rate the respect of who gat bigger
Banks been blowin' on purple stuff before that fat nigga
Henny's make dollars, and dollars make death threats
I'm doin' remixes to bulletproof the Lex next
Duck nigga, everdays war
I'm heavy on sports, to my draw like NBA's store
Don't make me send the piece at you
I'll have your man walk around with another rest in peace tattoo
Look creampuff, you can get killed here
Nigga you ain't invincible, even Superman in a wheel chair
I've always been a picky man, but I ain't a flowered star
So I'mma fuck all fifty fans
Look, whether you like it or not, right in ya spot
All in your grill, wearin' the crown, airin' em down
We're in the pound puttin' fare in the clown
I'm running with gangstas, don't make one of em shank ya
 G-UNIT! I started my own gang

 G-UNIT! I started my own gang

I'mma ride with my rap shit and my body armor
Ride like a Taliban suicide bomber
Four five six feet, I off ya feet
I kill ya with a pillow when you fall asleep
Your records can't sell, your company is buyin' em
Give it up, Burger King is hirin'
You shoulda been a cop, cause you snitch a lot
Talkin' to the jakes, you bound to get shot
I used to watch Big Bird and Scooby Doo
Now I'm choppin' big birds and them bundles too
For that Master P money, that shoppin' spree money
That coke, that dope and that ecstasy money
I'm tryin' to build empires across the state line
So move like vampires, never see me in the daytime
I jump out with a nina and a mack
I have you like Khia, my neck, my back
I hear a lotta talkin', niggaz must be mad at Banks
But there's only one problem, niggaz ain't as bad as Banks
Nigga, yous front, you gon get shot down
We fend to pump crack at cho spot now, G-Unit
Nigga, ain't nuttin' change, you move I'll blow your brains
These niggaz don't really want war
They just walk around frontin' 'cause I walk around stuntin'
Why you think the long pump is in the trunk for?
If you really want somethin' we can show up at your front door
I know my history, my family tree don't said 'Master'
Fuck livin' positive 'cause negativity spreads faster
A celebrity has ta, bulletproof his car
'Cause big hits come flyin' through ya door like Casper
I'm smokin' out the jar, scopin' out the bar
Distracted, see shorty breast pokin' out the bra
Not the type to go spark metal in
Start thinkin' you gangsta 'cause you hit a park yellow van
Act hard but ya heart made a marshmallows, man
Talk tough 'til you get cuffed and start tellin' damn
Everyday I got a new bitch and when I'm done wit her
It'll look like she dived head first in the pool wit it
You only gon wind up dead tryin' to prove shit
I put chalk around ya head like a pool stick
I gotta have bucks on the waist
I'm hungry like a South African with fly stuck to his face
Catch Banks in a truck full of bass
Remember I'm a bachelor, the 4 or 5 ducks outta space
You could either get bucked or get ya ass jumped
The only trigger you can touch is on a gas pump
I got my own personal slave, she really got a curfew
Cook and clean for the kid like silly in color purple
I know you wanna pop me but if I hit you first
The exit wound gon be the size of a hockey puck
Fuck, I really hold the rubber
I send sparks at you and I don't mean Emilio or Bubba
I'm aimin' for a video cover, huge tall bustas
A pound and a philly hold the smuggler
G-Units, what's up right now?
The Gucci cloth is on a Newport sign upside down
You gotta come a little harder, nigga
You wear jerseys while mine a throwback and yours is a Starter
You still gotta beg a hoe
And you mad 'cause you blowin' on oregano
You niggaz'll never blow, anyone to step in my ring is brave
I don't know a thing about hair stylin' but I can make a finger weave
Short stay, leave her butt in the telly
Lace up the beef and broccolis, peanut butter and jelly
I'm about to get this deal shorty know
That's why she foamin' out the grill like a Alka-Seltzer pill
I ain't loud around a snitch
I don't crowd around a bitch
The jumpsuit match wit the Carolina kicks
I been sick since niggaz was on Harlod Miner dick
I could call up a chick and put a child around her lips
Niggaz can't stand the fact that I'm real
I kidnap the queen from the castle and put her back on the pill
Gimme Barbie at her best, Bacardi at the chest
I'm similar to the young Marcus Darvy at the desk
Useta have ta push up, now I hardly got to press
Got two gun, and both lead to cardiac arrest
My success got suckers salty blowin' steam like a cup of coffee
Click POW, get these fuckas off me
I hear a lotta talkin', niggaz must be mad at Banks
But there's only one problem, niggaz ain't as bad as Banks
Nigga yous front, you gon get shot down
We fend to pump crack at cho spot now, G-Unit
Nigga ain't nuttin' change, you move I'll blow your brains
Yea, Lloyd Banks, nigga, what's up, nigga?
It's 50, nigga,you fuckin' wit him right?
I know you fuckin' wit him 'cause I said you fuckin' wit him
That's my baby right there, that's my boy right there, my young nigga
What's up nigga, what the fuck?
I hear niggaz hollerin' that, keep it real and all that nigga
Nigga, if you talkin, all that gangsta shit
Nigga, we get it poppin', nigga
What's up, nigga? Anytime, nigga
I don't give a fuck if it's 4 in the afternoon, nigga
Anywhere you see me, nigga, let's go
Hold up son, them niggas know
Who hit that nigga, son

How the fuck we gon' know who hit 'em
And they don't know who hit him
The hood talkin' man everybody know

Now I lay thee down to sleep
Niggas tryin' to lay me down with heat
If I should die do' before I awake
I pray my Lord my soul to take
If dead men could talk in your sleep
And your homie told you who got him
Would you have the heart to shoot the nigga that shot him
Or would you start switchin' up?
You think about the penitentiary, your bitchin' up?
What if he said money ain't everything
The hood raised us wrong
What it takes to get your money long
But look I'm gone
Would that touch your heart have you feelin' funny inside
Would that be enough to make your punk ass ride
What if he gave you a li'l list of things to do
Said he wouldn't have to die, he could live through you
Would you load your gats and get ready ro ride
Or would you lock the door at your crib and hide
It's a cold world even when it's hot outside
Whether sunshine or rain, you still feel pain
Hit him 'cause he was your strength
Now you in a daze
Your homie turnin' over in his grave
'Cause you pussy
Ya know who killed him
Ya know who killed him
Ya know who killed him

Ya know who killed him
Ya know who killed him
Ya know who killed him

Them boys smoked your homie
You ain't gon' do nothin' back
Not even if he told you, you next to get clapped
It don't take much for them shells to make the best of you
Your peoples probably gon' cremate and burn the rest of you
You done did too much dirt to try and make it to heaven
Nigga, is you down for this 1 8 7
When you reach the pearly gates, how you gon' explain?
You gonna try and tell God you've been framed
Y'all did everything together, he was your dog
Now you uptown coppin' and he in the morgue
Them niggas he gave pacs to they kept the cake
His sister and baby momma talkin' to Jake
Da' niggas that rocked him they came to the wake
But they come inside, they sat out in the ride
At the funeral, homicide, all in the business
Walkin' 'round askin' niggas to tell 'em who did it
Niggas is throwin' blows, now you ready to rumble?
Thirsty niggas an animal, the hood is a jungle
Broke nigga, will body someone over a bundle
Man, a three year old kid in my hood know what a gun do
Ya know who killed him
Ya know who killed him
Ya know who killed him

Ya know who killed him
Ya know who killed him
Ya know who killed him

Ya know who killed him
Ya know who killed him
Ya know who killed him

...
 (chorus)
You not ready for me nigga you not ready for me

You not ready for me nigga you not ready for me

You not ready for me nigga you not ready for me

It's G-Unit and we bout to get this fuckin' hoe

Yea nigga I'm the first one up
I heard you been talking mad shit
why don't you just step the fuck up
Get in my face and see whats happens
I'll take you out you wont know what happened like poof its magic
yea I pull magic tricks I'm like B rabbit
I beat the hell out of all you faggots
I do it big just like a real savage
Game wanna mess wit us we'll do it back
Fuck all this 'get rid of beef' y'all heard that
You wanna know whats happens when you mess wit G-Unit
You get dropped,shot and punched in yo shit bitch


Uhh Yea
Sit down 50 man let me get on this nigga
he talkin' like he a G
But he don't wanna see me in the streets
Niggas get capped up, smacked up and killed
I like to do it gangsta style yea I do it for real
I'll be yo dentist get yo chest filled Wit bullets
Yea yo plan failed to ruin the G-units name
Lets do it like Trina and stop playin' games
I'm a spit heat flashes make you look like a lame
And when I head in the club hoe's give me they name
I'll do it like li'l' flip and say
You a lame so yo dame must be playin mind games
If you think you mess wit G-unit
Think about we go in the streets and handle our business


I'm back on that gangsta shit
When I'm in the streets y'all know who I'm wit
G-unit we kill niggas that talk shit
The Game has gotten so selfish
We the one's who put him on the map
Take this track rewind it like Boom Boom Clap
And you'll find out who's goin' get ya
we always goin' be on 106&park; like yo twin Big Tigga
I hope you figured out why we made this song
Cuz you really don't want to fuck wit us we King Kong

G-Unit (What)
We in here (What)
We can get the drama popping
We don't care (What, what, what)
It's going down (What)
'Cause I'm around (What)
50 Cent, you know how I gets down (Down)

What up, Blood? (What)
What up, 'cause? (What)
What up, Blood? (What)
What up, Gangstaaa?

They say I walk around like got an "S" on my chest
Naw, that's a semi-auto, and a vest on my chest
I try not to say nothing, the DA might want to play in court
But I'll hunt or duck a nigga down like it's sport
Front on me, I'll cut ya, gun-butt ya or bump ya
You getting money? I can't none with ya then fuck ya
I'm not the type to get knocked for D.W.I.
I'm the type that'll kill your connect when the coke price rise
Gangstas, they bump my shit then they know me
I grew up around some niggas that's not my homies
Hundred G's I stash it (what), the mack I blast it (yeah)
D's come we dump the diesel and battery acid
This flow's been mastered, the ice I flash it
Chokes me, I'll have your mama picking out your casket, bastard
I'm on the next level, right lane forget bezzle
Benz pedal to the metal, hotter than a tea kettle, god (what)


We don't play that
We don't play that
We don't play that (G-Unit)
We don't play around

I sit back, twist the best bud, burn and wonder
When gangstas bump my shit, can they hear my hunger?
When the 5th kick, duck quick, it sounds like thunder
In December I'll make your block feel like summer
The rap critics say I can rhyme, the fiends say my dope is a nine
Every chick I fuck with is a dime
I'm like Patty LaBelle, homie, I'm on my own
Where I lay my hat is my home, I'm a rolling stone
Cross my path I'll crush ya, thinking I won't touch ya
I'll have your ass using a wheelchair, cane, or crutches
Industry hoe fuckers, in the hood they love us
Stomp a bone out your ass with some brand new chuckas



There's only one God sonny, and there ain't no replacement
And anybody thinking different just get locked in the basement
You know we had to touch the beat cause the track is dope, nigga
And throw some bullet's at you the size of cantaloupes, nigga
A lot of niggas rolling around like they can't get touched
Even the pope know to stay in bullet proof Benz trucks
Flipmode up in this bitch, ya niggas know we on fire
We hang niggas like old sneakers from telephone wires

Flip mode!

Is it worth it, let me work it
I put my thing down, flip it and reverse it

If you got a big [elephant], let me search ya
To find out how hard I gotta work ya


Uh Yeah
Now Missy she too much for me
She took me to to the crib man, she told me
Now my baby mama I told her ass not to beat me
Her broke ass wanna fight, Missy know how to treat me
She sitting on cash, she got money out the ass
Gave her them back shots and got money out her ass
Now you can see me in the coupe like what!
Next time I'll hit her in that G5 truck!
I've got the magic stick, I can go for hours
From the bed to the floor, to the sink to the shower
With her back to the bed and her legs to the sky
I can go hard, know why, big girls don't cry
I had visions of Missy with her money by the tub
Ching! Ching! Jackpot, I think I'm in love
I'm looking for Missy now so I can get my back rubbed
This the shit she hollered in my ear before we left the club

I wish that t-bone was 6 0 for the big hoes haha
No if you the star stick mode the flip mode
BLAH~

Niggas impersonating God and 2pac, one

Shadyville Entertainment, Bad Boy collaboration

I love niggas, I love niggas~!
Cause niggas are meeeee
And I should only love that which is meeeee
I love to see niggas go through changes
I love to see niggas, shoot the shit
But there's one thing about niggas I do not love

Yeah... did it again nigga!

To all my Brooklyn "Niggas!!"
To all my Uptown "You niggas understand!!"
To all my Bronx "In this world nigga!!"
To all my Queens bridge "Swept you away.."

Back up chump, you know Biggie Smalls rips it quick
and kicks it quick, you know how black niggaz get
with the hoods fatigues with the boots with trees
Smokin' weed, flippin' ki's, makin' crazy G's
Hittin' buckshot at niggaz that open spots
on the avenue, take my loot, and I'm baggin' you
Pimpin' hoes that drive Volvo's and Rodeos
Flash the roll, make 'em wet in they pantyhose
Damn, a nigga style is unorthodox
Grip the Glock, when I walk down the crowded blocks
Just in case a nigga wanna act out
I just black out, and blow they motherfuckin' back out

We the realest nigga
50 Cent and B.I.G. my nigga
Don't try to act like you don't feel us nigga
Biggie yo' nigga, 50 yo' nigga
Squeeze the trigger, leave a nigga fa' sho'!
We the realest nigga
50 Cent and B.I.G. my nigga
Don't try to act like you don't feel a nigga
Biggie yo' nigga, 50 yo' nigga
Squeeze the trigger, leave a nigga fa' sho'!

Then we smoke spliffs, we pack four-fifths
Just in case dread wanna riff
He get a free lift to the cemetery, rough very
Not your ordinary, we watch you get buried
That's a real nigga for ya
Get mad do a quarter flip the script, and rip your lawyer
Spit at the D.A., cause fuck what she say
She don't give a fuck about your ass anyway
Up North bound first stop, Water town or Bitch-skill
Where the hand skills are real ill
You'll be a super Hoover doo-doo stain remover
Ha hahhh, yo chief, pass the Buddha


When I was young my M.O. was to go hand-to-hand
Even my P.O. she called me the Ginger Bread Man
I catch a new case, and tell her ass "catch me if you can"
Don't let your people fill you up wit octane, I'm not playing
Get gassed up to get blast up
Real B.I.G. style watch the kid break it down
Check it - thou shalt not fuck wit North C. Papa
50 Cent, I'll break yo ass off propa'
There's no place like home, New York - New York
I run the city, and I don't dance around like Diddy
Niggas is giddy, till they smacked silly or sprayed wit the Mac Milli
They don't want drama really
Pussy niggaz get hard lip syncin' my lyrics like Milli Vanilli
In the hood they feel me {*gun cocked*} hah!! I'm on fire!
Niggas out in Philly they feel me, they bump my shit
Every bootlegger you know, pump my shit bitch!

Marsh' knows man
Talk tough, 'til you get cuffed and start tellin', damn~!
Everyday I shot a new bitch
And when I'm done with her it'll look like...

At first they didn't want me, now they want me
See a nigga gettin' paid they wanna push up on me
You should see these hoes chasin' a nigga
I have 'em in the hotel tastin' a nigga
50 like a lollipop, lick me baby
Then lick Dr. Dre and Shady, OH~!
{*set to B.I.G.'s "The World is Filled..." instrumental*}

Yeah... 50 Cent, uh-huh
Governor, G-G-G-G-G-Unit~!
She ain't that chick from the burbs that's a stranger to drama
She that Uptown Girl with the cock at the sauna
Went out her way to let her know that I want her
I told her I - know fo' sho' we belong together
And I wouldn't break her heart, my intentions are better
And I, shared the same dreams she had about cheddar
When the D's came she was down to hold the Beretta
I got a thing for baby girls, me and her against the world

We used to think the same schemes, with the same dreams in mind
10'll bring you back 20 if the crook is on time
And she knows daddy loves to eat
Take a seat and let my baby rub my feet
She was a clear thinker, with a plan to rule the world
But understandin' her place is my girl
Talk about hardcore, to win she'd give her life
Or shoot to kill, to protect this life

The world will hear, what's really goin on, in my life - my life
The world will see, what was really down down, in my life - my life
If you only knew, the pain I feel; if you only could feel the streets is real
If they only knewwwwww, what's goin onnnnnnn, yeah~!

You're sunshine, your smile make my day
It's simple - your dimple your eyes
Your lips, your thighs, got me hypnotized
Communication's deep, I love it when we talk
Hate it when you leave but when you leave I love to watch you walk
You make a nigga forget about a life full of drama
She got expensive taste, she get it from her momma
Materialistic; still a nigga want her
Consistently missin' her touch when she gone, uhh
She smell like Chanel, she feelin' me and I can tell
With the right woman by my side I feel like I can't fail
I've been around been up and down my attitude is fuckin ass
She a rider, I'm in heaven when I'm inside her
Workin' up a sweat, kissin' on her neck, "12 Play" in the deck
Fo'play correct, have her drippin' wet
She looked in my eyes and say she like it but I know she love it
I just keep doin' what I'm doin' and think nuttin' of it
 w/ ad-libs
{*abruptly ends halfway during the last line of the Chorus*}
"STOP!!"
'nonstop'
Yeah
She kiss it she suck it
She want me to want it
She like it she love it
She want to climb up on it
Smile
Ha-ha
50 Cent
Yeah... look
Look mami we can
Feet and stilletto take a
Sneak in the meadow and ya
Creep through the ghetto wit ya
Cartlan party is when ya
Can head to the house from the
House to thew floor
From the floor to the couch

Mmm, yeah, uhh
Mind playing tricks on me man
It's a, regular day and a regular routine
'Til I hear this tragic news from about two fiends
Your man 50, just got popped 9 times
And I heard through the grapevines it's all cause he rhymes
In front of his grandma, I'm standin' on the lawn
Wearin' no Teflon, I wonder if he gone
I know in my heart I wanna cry
Havin' thoughts in my mind is my man gon' die?
As I frantically run towards 50 spot
I panicky peep like fifty cops
It was blue & whites, DT's and homicide
With yellow tape locked off on both sides
With four-fifth shells on the floor
And DT's ringin' doorbells, goin door to door
Yo I'm stressed out, smokin' bogie after bogie
Duckin' the sarge cause the sarge fuckin know me
I jumped in Jeep truck and got a mac to spit
And we did about a buck cause Mary Mack I lit
at the time, I started thinkin' back some shit
How we used to sling crack and stack our chips
With Kev, P-Low, Big Jewel the Kid
And my man 50 used to smack a bitch
And the good and the bad on the 1-3-4
And them hoes that we had on the Cash Money tour
Now I'm at the hospital, stop daydreamin'
All I see is 5-5-1 and there's beefin'
Baby moms is screamin', whole family grievin'
But the word is, that my man's still breathin'
I dropped to my knees and I thanked the Lord
And got a long shit list all across the board
Motherf... {*ends*}

You see a nigga soft, my first instinct is to lean on
A weak nigga eatin' in my hood, niggas'll put a beam on 'em
These niggas aint supposed to be eatin' yo
This sweet is sweet an' low, I'll have 'em like shit was all good just a week ago

Let Drake get you niggas in the mood for love
I'm back to get you in the mood for the snub and gloves
Dope fiend, morphine, cocaine dilemma
Crack come to cooking up that, boy I'm a chemist
F-ck pill poppin, a strap I pop that
Watch the Henchman trial, see a rat rat on a rat
Got a nice gimmick going, you've been hot a few summers
But I got the type of flow that'll stop World hunger
SK, I got nothing but energy
Call me Fifty, call me Ferrari the remedy
Hi again in case a hater don't remember me
I happen to be what these rap niggas here pretend to be
Hittin you won't be enough, you gotta finish me or it's Ruger time
The SR9 fragments ricochet in ya ass go blind
Times up, ya f-cked, gotta learn to duck, wassup

Don't make me (don't, d-d-don't)
Don't make me (do it)
Don't make me (you know I do it)
Show you whats up
Don't make me f-ck you up

Listen any bitch on the milk box aint missin'
I mean some of these hoes running round with Pippen
I'm writing reality it sounds harsh
Shyne (Sean?) try to get at me he sounds washed
I aint even fire back the shits washed
What kind of shit is that, this only happens in rap
These niggas so fake, it make my skin crawl
Hope I aint the last real nigga up over the wall
Ice chunks in the chain, weight spinnin, cream linen
Bulges from the Benjamin's in 'em
Tom Ford, oh Lord, if I aint know better I think a nigga push raw
It feels like it's never gon stop
A nigga so hot, I may spend forever on top
 Forever in the drop
Cant til I got it on lock
Bitch
Nobody likes me
Nobody likes me, but that's okay
Cause I don't like y'all anyway
And I don't like y'all anyway
Fuck all y'all!
My watch talk for me, my whip talk for me
My gat talk for me
What up homie
For bitches who don't know me
They want to blow me 'cause the shit I floss wit sayin a lot for me
I came into rap humble, I don't give a fuck now
Serve anybody like niggas who hustle uptown
Coke price go up, cats is come down
The D's run in my crib, I'm nowhere to be found
The bitch who hustle for me, they don't even stash tracks
They keep it on em, right there in they ass crack
When I don't like a nigga, I don't pretend to
I'll have the paramedics wrap your fucking head like a Hindu
Look, I ain't going nowhere, so get used to me
OG's look at me and see what they used to be
I'm that nigga that sold coke, the nigga that sold dope
The nigga that shot Dice when he broke to So So
The thug, they pop shit
The thug that pop clips
The thug that went from three and a half to whole bricks
Nigga ain't in his right mind, going against me
My picture's painted through words that make a blind man see
Scream murder! (I don't believe you!)
Murder! (Fuck around and leave you!)
Murder! (I don't believe you!)
Murder, murder! (Your life's on the line!)
Y'all niggas don't want no parts of me
I'm trying to figure out how y'all started me
Make me catch her on the late night
Pop shots wit the fifth and slide off wit the six
I'm not a marksmen while spark issue, I spray random
Not a pretty nigga but my moms think I'm handsome
I hate to hear "He say, She say" shit
Unless he say she say she on my dick
It's no coincidence, niggas who fuck wit me get shot up
I do a Cali style drive by and tear ya block up
You soft through, be putting up a crazy front
I stay wit the Mac, 'cause niggas tried to blaze me once
In the hood they be like, "Damn, 50 really spitted on em"
"You heard that shit?" "Yeah, 50 really shitted on em"
Beef, you don't want none, so don't start none
You just a small player in this game, play a part son
Scream murder! (I don't believe you!)
Murder! (Fuck around and leave you!)
Murder! (I don't believe you!)
Murder, murder! (Your life's on the line!)
These cats always escape reality when they rhyme
That's why they write about bricks and only dealt wit dimes
Leave it to them, and they say they got a fast car
Nascar, truck wit a crash bar
And TV's in the dash, pa
See em in the five wit stock rims, I just laugh, pa
I catch stunts when I ain't trying
I ain't lying, I sit Don P til I split up
Keep my rent split up
Get outta line, I get you hit up
Now if you say my name in your rhyme, watch what you say
You get carried away, you can get shot and carried away

50, Jay-Z and Nas
I'ma say this shit now and never again
We ain't buddies, we ain't partners and we damn sure ain't friends
The games you playing, you get killed like that
Acting like you all hard, you ain't built like that
See me when you see me nigga, one
Scream murder! (I don't believe you!)
Murder! (Fuck around and leave you!)
Murder! (I don't believe you!)
Murder, murder! (Your life's on the line!)
Y'all niggas don't want no parts of me
I'm trying to figure out how y'all started me
Make me catch her on the late night
Pop shots wit the fifth and slide off wit the six

Basically we all turned up, all the way turned up

That it's 'Tell me how you go so long?'
Non-stop, please can we take a break
She said "I need water, I need water"
I don't need no crowd round when I'm performing,
No TV, no lights, no camcorder

Come on, party people my style is terrific,
My write is prolific, but let's be specific
K.R.S specialize in music, I specialize selling dimes,
Cock the nine, and use it,
Taught us to run from the D's, then come back to it,
Bet i make my bitch trip'n the next time I use it
This is gutter... that hood shit
No question, it's that good shit
You ain't felt like this in a minute
Flow so sick I have niggas in the clinic
I guess I should thank you
For motivating me to do things you said I can't do
You said I can't be number 1 all the time
And I can't make my money stack up to the sky
Said I can't get licked by the baddest bitch
Not idolising to me man I'm mad as shit
And I hate to be the one that say ''I told you so''
But I've been ''told you so'' , and now I'm back in here
I wanna thank you, heavenly father
For shining your light on me
You send me ... love me
And now just my body
You kiss me happy so very happy
He loves me, I throw my ...
It's been a long time since I had someone who loves me
I owe my thanks to thee
And I know, I know it couldn't have happen without you, without you
, uhu, without you, uhu
I know it couldn't have happen without you, without you, without your love, uhu
I know it couldn't have happen without you, without you, uhu, uhu without you
I know it couldn't have happen without you, without you

Ay yo fif' I was thinking you should go back to doing the shit you used to do

Murder them, murder them
They violate, I demonstrate
Yeah, I'll murder them
Niggas be fronting word up
They stunting till they hurt up
That semi talk I'll let it buck
I had these niggas running hard
I'll pull a nigga's skirt up and have him kicking dirt up
I'll get a nigga an' a nigga back up stupid hard
Silence it's the return of the tyrant
Seein' through my third eye with both closed eyelids
Stand closer to the homie you gon' to die with
Flames come up out the muzzle wanting shit that I did
I'm talking like the feds ain't listening
Nigga this is a pool of piranhas you're fishing in
I give to a nigga if he want it
Better ask niggas about me I'll be on it
I get to drop, blow out your knot, perfect planning
Hit your back with something hot out the cannon

It's murder one, it's premeditated
Murder, then it's another one
Back to back, put work in
It's murder one, it's premeditated
Murder, then it's another one
Back to back, put work in
You know I ain't got the strap on me
Holding that for me

I'm f-cked up, it really doesn't matter though
Hundred 9mm shells in the Calico
Wait, niggas drop like dominos
Run for your life, puta si vmonos
I was taught to see my crew a long time ago
Grew up around cocaine, yeah even my mamma know
I cut a O in the fo' with seven at a time
Made four hundred of that, you know a nigga grind
Like Cindy Lauper bitch, time after time
A nigga shine like a nickel nine
I've been talking to the man in the mirror
Nigga so ass they was shaking like Shakira
It seems like my vision's gettin' clearer
See me coming with the hammer out, death is gettin near ya
It's funny how niggas never hear ya, till you run down on 'em
Gun down on 'em

It's murder one, it's premeditated
Murder, then it's another one
Back to back, put work in
It's murder one, it's premeditated
Murder, then it's another one
Back to back, put work in
Yeah starting to feel like the old me (ha ha)
Theres something about the way i get it

Theres something about the way I did it
Like there's nothing to it

You don't wanna see a n-gga doing bad

You're working my nerves and I aint got patience
Barrell on my tre pound, I'll let ya ass taste it

This little light of mine, I'm gon let it shine
Right under the barrell, I'm sure I wont miss
Say a prayer I don't care, I'm here for the money
Pay dumb, get done, call it murder one
Six shots pop, hit a pop, bullets ricochet
Your catching hot, hell so far away
Cough up the cash before shit get really bad
You don't really really wanna see a n-gga when he mad

My blade'll turn a line man into a feather weight
Who me? I wanna warn you muthaf-ckers ain't seen nothing like me
Still looking for a ? and my wrist so icy
I tell the homies these niggas is full, eat 'em
They coming out the awards wearing their good clothes, need 'em
Take it off, tell that sucker "take it off"
They ain't come up how we came up, man they niggas so soft
Half man half dog man my niggas sense fear
Brought 'em here in a Lear to take your Audemere

Nigga round the clock non stop
Niggas is hungry on my block
I'm from south side nigga where the gangstas play
Make one false move and you're blown away
I make it so hot nigga my block
Seventeen clip filled up with nine shots
I'm from south side nigga where the gangstas play
Make one false move and get blown away

Don't get coffee with me p-ssy I told you before
It's outlaw, lawless I f-ck you up regardless
Niggas say they be work in I wanna see what they saying
Put that work in without a mans, bring me that nigga, chain him
ATL BET we can AR in the park
Make the parking lot sound like an Iraq bar
Feel the mood change when I step through the door
Go head make me f-ck you up that's what we came here for
Gym star, carve you up nice
Have so much fun I wanna do it twice
That's my bitch on the pole
You tipping she's stripping
I'm known for tripping
I just slapped the clip in
599 Ferrari state dipping
Cash getting, brick flipping
Straight clip in, good ghetto living
Big better vision
Bigger plans for a bigger bed to get in

Nigga round the clock non stop
Niggas is hungry on my block
I'm from south side nigga where the gangstas play
Make one false move and you're blown away
I make it so hot nigga my block
Seventeen clip filled up with nine shots
I'm from south side nigga where the gangstas play
Make one false move and get blown away

Yeah, ya'll see me laying low, I got so much shit to say
I'm a play, we gon spar from now to the fight
You understand how this goes down right?
You seen this movie before, this a rerun
'Fore what we call it? We call it Get Rich Or Die Trying
Huh, D12 niggas that time
Nah nah nah, we call it the massacre.
We did 10 million that time
What we gonna call it?
Huh

Imagine I was broke right now
Saying damn, where my friends go
Cat burgler style, I'm coming through your window
Bitch I'm so focused, n-gga I'm so focused
Slim chance I'ma go back to killing roaches
Be quiet, you can hear the rats in the wall
Make you want to pump crack til you stack racks
The dope bring the dough in, shawn sister, she hoeing
Like Brenda with her baby, she six months, she showing
For 50 should suck that, for a buck you could f-ck that
And you thinking she nasty, but n-ggas is nasty
Dice game shake em up, praying for a six
The wolves out there hungry, they looking for a lick
Sun down to sun up, they looking for a come up
10-30 in progress right in your projects
They boosting, you like Gucci, they got it
Spot it, and every other high end product
I put you on, my man's man, got a credit card scam
Come through later, I'ma plug you in fam
N-ggas pissed on the staircase in an elevator
Now I'm pissed cause I'm starting to smell like this player
My little man get bread, I tell you what he doing
He bag up for days till cocaine in his urine
His momma got bills he avoiding the eviction
He play lookout and warn n-ggas when the dicks coming

You can say I'm ghetto, ghetto like a muthaf-cker
Pack heat, heavy metal like a muthaf-cker
You can say I'm ghetto, ghetto like a muthaf-cker
Pack heat, heavy metal like a muthaf-cker
You can say I'm ghetto, ghetto like a muthaf-cker
Pack heat, heavy metal like a muthaf-cker
You can say I'm ghetto, ghetto like a muthaf-cker
Pack heat, heavy metal like a muthaf-cker

Mikey put his foot to a bitch ass on some pimp shit
10 hoes, 10 g's a night, n-ggas getting rich
Any n-gga get out of line, I got 'em
Southside across my back, I'm from the bottom
All a n-gga need is a block and a connect
And a box of 9mm's to load in the tech
The beef all gravy, a n-gga half crazy
You pull it, better bang it
Cause n-ggas will bring it
That kush moving faster than crack, n-gga its burning
Now move a couple pounds of that, now you're earning
Stack paper on every flip, get the whip
Than get a new bitch and forget the one you with
She said she could do bad all by her damn self
N-gga let her do bad all by her damn self
A bitch'll tell when the pigs come
Won't even try to make bail when the pigs come
Just let her do her own thing

I took a sip of the potion
Lil SK, a little Goose, now Im loose

Quest for the cheddar I bought shiny Beretta
Im firing squad hard, you niggas should know better
Than to bump with Ferrari, calamari
I kill like rebels in , Im sorry
I ball like I think Im the Prince of Abu Dhabi
Black gold gush out the ground
Gun powder fly out the pound
I turn a clown smile upside down
Thats 3 time zones in my watch face
Still hard to tell time with diamonds all over my watch face
Twinkle like Im outta space, Im a big dipper

Nice wheels, but dont talk money, thats what Im about

And your neighbours and ya yard, oh my God
This shit aint about shit so I aint gon go hard

"Niggas bit off Nas shit"
"Admit it, you bit it"
"Niggas bit off Nas shit, niggas, niggas, bit off, Nas shit"
"Admit it, you bit it, bit it"
You can be a ridah and ride, or a coward and hide
Either way you go against me, you still gon' die
I got four macs, a few nines, I'm ready for beef
You wanna talk, it ain't about money, then let it be brief
I need a drop for when it's a hot, a hummer for when it's cold
An ill attorney's in my corner when these fake niggas fold
The shit I kick fuck with niggas mentally, makes them wanna mention me
And see me doing a quarter century in the penitentiary
Nastradamus predicted 50's the future, that's a fact money
I run up on your workers with the mac, like where that pack money
I'm a tell y'all what papi told me
I got what you need, 19,5 a key
I stay catching a stunt, frontin' in somethin' mean
And I'll clap any nigga for the right amount of cream
Run up on them all with the same problem solver
Beat up ass, tape on the handle, trey eight revolver
What!

Project's too hot, niggas better hope we never hit rock
'Cause then we gonna run up in your spot
Screamin' get the fuck on the floor, give us the ro'
Aiyyo, aiyyo, aiyyo, aiyyo
I'm like sugar Shane Mosley, it ain't no beef
You're staring, a ticket holder that sits in row three
Next to Ron Artest and Kobe
Yo I woulda went pro too, then I let them Phillies slow me
I'm like a black man's asthma, seeking a pump
Breathin' deeper when I'm creeping up
Y'all need to fuck with the tightest, I stick niggas
Encephalitis leavin' whole families in silence
My virus is obvious, past on to most rap fiends
Uncured, ain't no vaccine
Last seen at the automatic teller machine, maxing out
Or in the studio booth, blacking out
It's con-ed style, real twisted, I disappear on some Blair Witch shit
Comin' back I'm rich kid
Either or, you can't stop me with my feet in the door
Or walk away from the street or the morgue, play your part, nigga.
Project's too hot, niggas better hope we never hit rock
'Cause then we gonna run up in your spot
"Niggas bit off nas"
"Admit it, you bit it"
"Tell these niggas somethin', God"
What, yo
I disturb niggas and white boys, with five pointed stars
Tatted on they arms, pimp your moms, like I'm magic Don Juan
From queens to Hong Kong, weed in the bong
We smoke that, leave our minks on the coat rack
Those that plot on me, nine times outta ten the nine is on me
Feds search the god, but nothin' they find on me
When I rap don't wait to clap applaud sooner
Unless you hate a nigga like George Bush Jr., I bring awkward to you
Porsche maneuvers through the city like new york sewers
Stinkin' up the air, central park, horse manure
Rims is 22 inches, Benz suspensions
22 inch dick when I'm pimpin'
Impotent you niggas get me sick, wanna be soundin' like
You knowin' my arithmetic, but we don't sound alike
50 cent with bravehearted, we ride to the grave depart us
You fake niggas imitate what I started, let's go
"Niggas bit off Nas shit"
"Admit it, you bit it"
"Niggas bit off Nas shit, niggas, niggas, bit off, Nas shit"
"Admit it, you bit it, bit it"

This is how I'm feeling right now, I mean I'm blessed
Me I ain't got... around... doctor required
But nigger I'm cleaner than your motherfucking preacher on Sunday morning
Me I run the streets so ... ...hard to get by
But better be the cleanest motherfucker in the surfs on Sunday morning
I made so many mistakes, so many corrections, I'm so far from perfect, so many imperfections
But I'm a go getta,I get up and go get it , so if you're preaching prosperity I wanna hate it
I make the hood look good turn base into base lines,
punchlines to white lines, and run for them one time.
My verse is like a graphic scene, close your eyes man you seen it don't feel...
And you seen... puff glow, like there's no tomorrow
Hit that pass that, that's the motto, you know bills like they releasing from my friends
They gonna wake up tomorrow with the same shit again
You think I'm bad man they don't give a fuck
They're trying to do what they gotta do to get it from
Me I ain't got... around... doctor required
But nigger I'm cleaner than your motherfucking preacher on Sunday morning
Me I run the streets so ... ...hard to get by
But better be the cleanest motherfucker in the surfs on Sunday morning
I take a line out the cookbook,.... shoot me I shoot back I don't care if you die
First the sun comes down then the sun goes up
And the coke price too when the nigga's make a buzz
It's freeze nigger, get the fuck on the wall
Anything you work for they come and take it all
Man it's like they don't know what they're taking
Hit you with the tazer, then you siting like a victim
When you pray say a prayer for me, a nigger could use it
Before we pop up on that ass with toasters
Lord forgive me I'm the rest of the game
Forgive me for that line and the rest of my sins
If you think you're lonely now
Wait until tonight, girl
Ah man
If you think you're lonely now
Wait until tonight, girl
I'm waitin' on you to come, baby I'm that man
Bedroom superhero, naked I'm Batman
I kill it then I give ya mouth-to-mouth, CPR
Bring ya back to life, climax, start your after life
Bounce up and down on my love, this is chronic
Have it how you want it, my back shot's bionic
She givin' me something I can feel like En Vogue
Unload then reload, recharge, I'm back on
Back at it, fuckin' up the sprigs in her Craftmatic
Jack rabbit, addiction, I don't wanna break that habit
Your boy toy man, child it's cool, you can play with me
City life, bright lights, tonight you can stay with me
I wanna share thoughts, let's talk, go for a walk
Fantasies, we can get loose right in the park
Bullseye right through her head, to her heart
It's mental and physical, when you're gone, I'll be missin' you
You gon' get it, you gon' get it
I got a plan for you (Got it all planned girl)
Girl it's on 'til the 'mon when you come through (ha ha)
I can't think of a thing that I won't do (What you wan' do?)
When you come and I get my hands on you (Wait 'til I get you girl)
I'm Curtis Mayfield, Marvin, the new Bobby Womack
2012 freak shit, baby I'm all that
The touchin' and the teasin', the pleasure's the reason
I'm sure she'll be open from the lickin' and strokin'
Or how I say a line and it stimulates her mind
My sense of humor, I make her smile while passin' time
It's sexual, it's not perverted or obscene
The foreplay we play, until I touch her 'til she cream
Cash rules the shortie, she's something out a dream
Half J-Lo half Jessica Biel, she in between
Got that island girl swag, she Dutty Wine
When we get back to the spot, that ass is mine
See how I switch gears, her bra gone it's on
It's showtime, it's my turn to perform
Leave the lights on, while I get it, I got it good
She sayin' she love my show, I'm sayin' I knew she would

Im back on this shit again
This time its gon take a whole SWAT team to bring me in
Im back on this shit again
Im back on this shit again

I had the same vision cat had in 89
So all the work in Southside gon be mine
I got project protection, thats 10 grand a building
Some n-ggas say thats there spot we gon kill em
Its all simple math, now add it to automatic
Its filled to the tip of the clip I let it rip
Now run, cover your mother its on cocksucker
F-ck around, have a peice of your brain blown
Hop up on that long Tre pound, flame throwin
Now isnt this a beautiful day, look up
Its Angel skies in Pelican Bay
Surprise n-gga we all dying,

N-ggas get shooting at me, Imma come back

N-gga dont go f-cking with me if you dont want that

I got a bad Dominican bitch, built like Buffy the body
Got a new coke connect, my mexican little mommy
Got a plan for the cops in the raincoat
Automatic shotgun banging I spray some
Look, I got an NBA b-tch, see me ballin
She pull up in that Bentley only 4 in the morning
I f-ck like its my last peice of p-ssy Im on it
Bitch like Jiffy with the lube she want it
Suck the lights out me, I mean the life out me
I like the way she through it, like aint nothing too it
Now n-gga dont you dare trip over no bitch
After money, thats the number one reason to get hit
F-ck around

I guess this is 6 out of 6 muthaf-ckers

Tell me how do you want it, the knife or the razor
You running, I'm coming to get you boy
You can hide if you want but nothing can save ya
Times running out, I'ma get ya boy

I threw a b-boy style, bullet wound in my smile
That beef I cook it, n-ggas I gets down
Call it what you want, the clip, the ladder, banana
I bet when I squeeze it, n-ggas scatter
The hoes, thats a whole different story
Find out the baby aint mine, right there on Maury
Me I make the whip fishtail, trunk full of fishscale
Raw market itself, sucka the shit sell
Thats 36 o's of love, give me kiss, give me love
Get to talking in codes, the phones bugged
This Ferrari I get to the green, half man, hald machine
*Tu, tu, tu* I'm on ya head with the beam
So focused ferocious, I shoot ya pretty ass out them Gucci loafers
You're f-cking with the wrong one
The strong one that God gave the gift
Stop the hater shit, you wanna make it
Why would you be mad I dun made it bitch

Tell me how do you want it, the knife or the razor
You running, I'm coming to get you boy
You can hide if you want but nothing can save ya
Times running out, I'ma get ya boy

Get get gully, g-g-get gully
Get get gully, g-g-get gully
We get gully and we get money
Them schemin' ass chicks can't get shit from me

Rain drops from heaven the angels cryin'
It's raining outside, envision my gun firin'
Red and white flashes, the police coming
N-gga you aint hittin' none, why the f-ck are you running
I make your momma wish your ass was a stillborn
When that eagle get to chirping on the front lawn
Where's teh love, I don't know but here's the snub
Sucker barrel swallow the slug, die like a thug
You know it's really not worth it
To f-ck with me, you'd rather tongue kiss the serpent
Don't cry we all die
It's just a matter of time
N-gga one shot from the nine will shatter your spine
Uh, the last of my breed, criminal tendancies inside of an emcee
F-ck around I will line you
Run from me, I will find you
Forgot I'm nice, I will remind you


One, two, fifty coming for you
Three, four, better lock ya door
Five, six, grab ya crucifix
Seven, eight, don't stay up late
The monsters back

Fake bitches not responsive
Me, I'm in the streets rocking a piece that's retarded
In the diamond district with Jacob
Making loads, you little cons wanna save up

We come from Queens where we are taught to handle beef on our own
You call up cops, we get it poppin, we be out with the chrome

Diamonds blinking like ass, take a look at it

Hustle hard for cash so I can spoil that ass

'Cause her friends pump her head hull of bullshit a lot

Chanel bags I bought from boosters
To the hood I introduced her
She feisty and sometimes she want to fight me
People saying if I get knocked she ain't gon write me
The sick part is all that bullshit excites me

A thug's what I want

That he lace me with money
He knows when I want it
And I'm never gonna leave my baby

Ay yo I treat you like you need to be treated like you're special
Tie your hands to the bedpost when I caress you
When I met you it was Guess and Gap
Now it's Gucci and Prada
Took you from being a nine to being a dime
You complain that we don't spend time
When I'm OT on the grind going hard for mine
Yo when shorty say she hate me
You know she mean she love me
When she play me close at the bar
That mean she want some Bubbly
See my polying with another chick and shit get ugly
She want to flip threaten to run keys across my whip
Try to burn a nigga with some Hominy Briss
That's how she on it
When I met her she was lowkey
Now she want to OD
You know me I let her do her thing son
I say what I'm feeling
Niggas say that I'm illing
I sip Cristy so I'm pissy
Like a staircase in your building
What?

A thug is what I want
And a thug is what I need
And my friends don't understand
How my baby laces me
A thug is what I want
And a thug is what I need
And my friends don't understand
And I think its jealousy

police say it all started in south jamaica about two and a half miles away from the shooting on the bus at jamaica station

i was trying to get away from the area, after the first shot, it was very traumatizing to me like i've seen this happen a lot of times and didn't want to be involved. i didn't want to be that person that get a stray bullet or nothing like that

Oh now she like me, oh oh oh now they like me
All I want is a blow job
This bitch wanna be wifey
No 3-course meal, all I want is fast food
I wanna have fun, how about a cookie huh?
I don't wanna love you
I just wanna unbutton your blouse and let the girls out
I wanna fuck you
Maybe later on, if you're free you can come to my house
Only if you want to
We can get freakier and freakier than you've ever been,
If you want to
We can get freakier and freakier you can bring a friend
Bitches from Belize, keep all in the weed
Remy crew got me sweating out a remi weave
Fuck a model tonight, my bitch is from the P's
She the project dick tease
Them hood bitches always bring back memories
They all catch the makers like "Yayo you remember me?"
I certainly do, pull the curtain on a '62
Hands was free, she on her menstrual
I promise I don't love em, I don't cuff 'em
I don't pay a bitch's rent to have the next nigga fuckin'
I'm a pimp with principles
Killin' with visuals my diamonds like two ? bitch
I don't wanna love you
I just wanna unbutton your blouse and let the girls out
I wanna fuck you
Maybe later on, if you're free you can come to my house
Only if you want to
We can get freakier and freakier than you've ever been,
If you want to
We can get freakier and freakier you can bring a friend
I don't want a relationship, I just wanna have fun
In every position, we can come up with til we're done
And my request is to be kickin' shit in my ear
Like to hear what you're thinking, after laughing and drinking
We can have a ball, we can do it all
Moonshine light up the sky at night time
With me any time could be the right time
I'm sort of impulsive, I'm kinda explosive
Me, take a little at a time in doses
Don't want you addicted, I just wanna kick it
You could pick the spot, I'll be there with the quickness
Give it to you good, when I'm gone I'm sure you gon' miss this
I don't wanna love you
I just wanna unbutton your blouse and let the girls out
I wanna fuck you
Maybe later on, if you're free you can come to my house
Only if you want to
We can get freakier and freakier than you've ever been,
If you want to
We can get freakier and freakier you can bring a friend
It go down, It go down, It go down
It go down, It go down
It go down, It go down, It go down
It go down, It go down
When it all goes down, and the clips run out
I bet I make history
I bet I make history
When it all goes down, and the cops come round
That murder's a mystery
That murder's a mystery

It's that gangsta shit, it sound stupid don't it
Feel like Fifty, Flocka and Gucci on it
Move grams of this, move O's of that
Move the muthaf-cking bricks, where the money at
Bitches scared huh, p-ssy, hold ya strength
When the beat pop off no controlling that
You wan' call the cops
Run call the cops
Look n-gga we don't care if they comin' or not
Got the pump in the trunk, n-gga biting a lot
One buck shot clear the whole block
Had this bitch taped off make it so hot
N-gga with a 12 gauge I'm a sure shot
Call it shell shock when ya ass drop
Get it shakin' like a muthaf-ckin' rattle n-gga
Go 'head f-ckin' with me and be a casualty
You think a n-gga bullshittin, then come and see
When it all goes down, and the clips run out
I bet I make history
I bet I make history
When it all goes down, and the cops come round
That murder's a mystery
That murder's a mystery

Now while you waitin', all debatin'
Shouldn't you n-ggas be retaliatin'
We laughin bout it, you cryin damn
Hit ya muthaf-ckin' homie when his gun jam
His chest red, his back red
Man, that n-gga there damn near dead
He coughin', he weezin'
Man that n-gga finna stop breathin'
His momma there, his daddy there
Hit him by the Escalade, get a caddy there
His shines on him, his dimes on him
Had hoes all in the club grindin' on him
N-ggas talkin' bout it, keep talkin' bout it
Cause they know n-gga don't give a f-ck
Quit talkin' bout it, for you talkin' bout it
When the muthaf-ckin pigs show up
When it all goes down, and the clips run out
I bet I make history
I bet I make history
When it all goes down, and the cops come round
That murder's a mystery
That murder's a mystery
If you think you're lonely now
Wait until tonight, girl
Ah man
If you think you're lonely now
Wait until tonight, girl
I'm waitin' on you to come, baby I'm that man
Bedroom superhero, naked I'm Batman
I kill it then I give ya mouth-to-mouth, CPR
Bring ya back to life, climax, start your after life
Bounce up and down on my love, this is chronic
Have it how you want it, my back shot's bionic
She givin' me something I can feel like En Vogue
Unload then reload, recharge, I'm back on
Back at it, fuckin' up the sprigs in her Craftmatic
Jack rabbit, addiction, I don't wanna break that habit
Your boy toy man, child it's cool, you can play with me
City life, bright lights, tonight you can stay with me
I wanna share thoughts, let's talk, go for a walk
Fantasies, we can get loose right in the park
Bullseye right through her head, to her heart
It's mental and physical, when you're gone, I'll be missin' you
You gon' get it, you gon' get it
I got a plan for you (Got it all planned girl)
Girl it's on 'til the 'mon when you come through (ha ha)
I can't think of a thing that I won't do (What you wan' do?)
When you come and I get my hands on you (Wait 'til I get you girl)
I'm Curtis Mayfield, Marvin, the new Bobby Womack
2012 freak shit, baby I'm all that
The touchin' and the teasin', the pleasure's the reason
I'm sure she'll be open from the lickin' and strokin'
Or how I say a line and it stimulates her mind
My sense of humor, I make her smile while passin' time
It's sexual, it's not perverted or obscene
The foreplay we play, until I touch her 'til she cream
Cash rules the shortie, she's something out a dream
Half J-Lo half Jessica Biel, she in between
Got that island girl swag, she Dutty Wine
When we get back to the spot, that ass is mine
See how I switch gears, her bra gone it's on
It's showtime, it's my turn to perform
Leave the lights on, while I get it, I got it good
She sayin' she love my show, I'm sayin' I knew she would

Niggas say they like my old shit
So I give them some old shit
What the fuck do I care, its old
Shit I'll give them some old shit
No, I'll give them some new shit
I'll just use my old flow
Looky here muthafucker I'm not playing
Look, look
Looky here muthafucker I'm not playing
Look, look

Wassup,
It's 'O11 why that Maybach an '06
This nigga boo booed up with my old bitch
I put paper before hoes, thats why I'm so rich
I paved the way, long dick, now we all fit
Doc check my temperature, why I'm so cold?
The hood left the left side of my chest froze
I'm more about pimpin' gettin' bank rolls
Sitting watch em trickin' on them stank hoes
We can share love like Kanye and Khalifa
From runways in Milan to big bags of reefer
She alright for a night but don't keep her
Ask Nas, Kelis was the illest Ether


My belt buckle YSL, my denim vintage
My AP all iced out, my shit authentic
My bread come in by the boat load, thats how I get it
The cops come, say I aint do what you know I did it
I aint trippin', na-na-na-na I aint trippin'
I am just putting the clip in
I aint at the window looking bitch
I am legend, I am lethal with the weapon
I am 50, I'm putting an end to niggas fucking with me
Yeah, I am back, I am ruler with a iron fist
I am strapped, what y'all niggas gon do with this
Wordplay all day, they say I got a gift
One shot from the fifth, niggas career shift



You think about money when you think about me huh,
That's what my ex, my ex you don't want to be her,
She used to have the beemer, now she own a sneaker,
I had her eating lobster now she eating pizza,
I think about Easter when I think about Keyshia,
Shorty stay fly that's why I keep her,
Round like the reefer, brown Mona Lisa,
She good if I leave her she got her own visa,
Think about them when you about frontin'
Think about stuntin' when you think about me,
I'm the boss Bentley or the Porsche,
Overseas, see jet skis slide across,
I love the way you dress,
Now take it off,
Put your legs high on my shoulders of course,
I'm racing through your mind but you already lost,
I'm at the finish line and your the friend of mine,
Come on lets ride
Just a lil' bit
Every now and then
God damn girl, we used to be friends
Just a lil' bit
Just a lil' bit
Just a lil' bit
Just a lil' bit
I think like a hustler,
I'm thinking bout a shipment,
She thinking I'm her husband,
So she thinking bout commitment,
Its like Paul McCartney stuck in my head,
Fell in love with a bitch walked away with one leg,
She ain't even have to run to get away with the bread,
That's some fucked up shit
Think about that kid,
I'm thinking what this bitch thinking when she take me to court,
I pay my child support, what the fuck she want,
This relationship, shit its too much for me,
I wanna fuck your friends and live comfortably
She wanna shine and blow minds on shopping sprees,
She should have what she wants just not for me,
I'm thinking bout my future she part of my past,
She don't care bout me she just want some cash,
I'm thinking damn girl, we used to be friends,
How did sh-t become all about ends
Just a lil' bit
Every now and then
God damn girl, we used to be friends
Just a lil' bit
Just a lil' bit
Just a lil' bit
Just a lil' bit
Do you think about me?

I know you think about me,

Just a lil' bit

Like turn an empty spot into a crack spot pumpin
im so hard at nine-teen I bought a benz, I did.
The older niggaz really wasn't feelin the kid
Try to find where I live so they could run in my crib
but you can't hustle a hustler I peeped it and slid
Back then, Niggaz used to call me bo
At six months I told them "Million go tops on Gar-bo"
Country came around, hes into clappin
country left, same shit started happening
Like "He shot rob for some ends, rob shot joe for some skins,
Cory shot drew and we was friends, money turned boys into men
The cycle never changes, shit just starts again.
"naw nigga, ain't nuthin changed nigga,
yea I've been gone for a minute, but I'm BACK!"

you see my cherry red SL nigga I'm doin good
sometimes I can't find the words to say how I feel

Sit tight nigga I'm comin! You know? New shit!
All the shit I put out on the mix tapes is for the mix tapes

...
OH MY GOD! My shit is so hot right now I'm in the zone
They say they do it, like I do it with no mask on
Nigga, get the f-ck outta line, you getting blast on
Jesus let the weak roam the Earth without a purpose.
Ill stomp ya f-cking head til its under the surface
Now I need you to get it through ya bloodclot head
Fore I put a bullet through ya bloodclot dreads
These niggas aint made of the same shit Im made of
I dumb a click for my man if he needs a favour
I let a nigga slide he came back and almost shot me
And he was thinking I was scared, nah nigga not me
You dont understand I was raised by the vultures
Still laughing like hyenas in the crib full of roaches
Call grandmami mommy cause mommy already dead
Daddy been missin since I was a little kid
Now who dared go there playin games with the orphan
They know my pedigree test me Imma off em
 (x2)
Stop the bloodclot crying
The kids, the dog, everybody dying, no lying
Dont cry, dry ya eyes
Dont cry, dry ya eyes
That first body drop, we just getting started, death come in threes
Ar15, M16, semi-automatic, murder machine
Wave that, blaze that, give a nigga wings
When that blade enter flesh its an emergency
Ya love leak, heart open call the surgery
Feels like my last girlfriend I lost her
On second thought I know just where I left her, the alter
See, Im at an advantage I dont care about tomorrow
Find out that I aint frontin when then patience start to fall
You know attempted murder was the case that they gave me
9 bullet wounds know, now Im half crazy
What is that a tear I see forming in ya eye
Why are you so frightened were all gonna die
You can say a prayer when Im coming like the reaper
Staring through that sight on the top of my heater


N-gga I ain't f-cking around,
SMS, get the message, get the message!
SMS, get the message!

I go hard full time, duck when I pull mine
I run from one time, f-ck a pig, ya dig?
I go to war with one nine
I work, you see mine,
But I ain't never ever gonna say I did it,
In a hoopty, hoody on, cruising the back locks
You stuntin' on hungry n-ggas, go ahead get your ass shot
Your neck got your chain on it
Bullet got your name on it,
I'm serious, sometimes it seems like I'm playin'
Dump a shell case in your face, The D's got 40?.
They tryna find a rat or call it a cold case
I know some n-ggas, some snitches
I know some bitches who's scared
I got some shooters around me and they stay fully prepared
We got them straps you n-ggas look at and flinch
Ghetto n-gga get rich, what you think I'ma get?
We got that pump in that chopper, we got the tech in that sweeper
We got that Ruger that Mac, I call it my bitch n-gga ether

All we do is get that grain,
And my n-ggas move cocaine
Plus we let them hammers bang
I'm talking 'bout the Unit gang.

Inhale! Smell the gunpowder, my hands is full of residue
N-ggas'll shoot n-ggas, you lucky it weren't you
N-gga, my best song, my chucks are bomb proof,
You shoot, I shoot back, find God when I'm on you
This aint tales of the crypt, n-gga, this tales of the hood
Stay the fuck out the way with your mouth shut like you should!
When the bullshit start I'mma find a spot
Aim it right at your knot than the shell cases'll drop
Man, you n-ggas don't know me, you know my government name
Go 'head ask about booboo, they tell you I let it bang
Got a big reputation, there's something wrong with my brain
N-gga front, I'mma squeeze it, go 'head stunt, I'm squeeze it


Yeah! Back on my shit, man!
I don't give a f-ck about fitting in
You n-ggas gonna follow me!
Back to the ground, n-gga we gonna make it nice and dirty!
Now wan' get dirty with me?
We gon' see if you all you n-ggas done with soft?
All y'all get with the shit man
This the shit man
All the real n-ggas feel it!
Rest of you RnB ass n-ggas
Go on, man! Go on play ya little song, n-gga
F-ck It!

Hustle hard for cash so I can spoil that ass

Chanel bags I bought from boosters
To the hood I introduced her
She feisty and sometimes she want to fight me
People saying if I get knocked she ain't gon write me
The sick part is all that bullshit excites me

A thug's what I want

Even though my friends don't seem to see
That he lace me with money
He knows when I want it
And I'm never gonna leave my baby
My thugged out no good baby

Ay yo I treat you like you need to be treated like you're special
Tie your hands to the bedpost when I caress you
When I met you it was Guess and Gap
Now it's Gucci and Prada
Took you from being a nine to being a dime
You complain that we don't spend time
When I'm OT on the grind going hard for mine
Yo when shorty say she hate me
You know she mean she love me
When she play me close at the bar
That mean she want some Bubbly
See my polying with another chick and shit get ugly
She want to flip threaten to run keys across my whip
Try to burn a nigga with some Hominy Briss
That's how she on it
When I met her she was lowkey
Now she want to OD
You know me I let her do her thing son
I say what I'm feeling
Niggas say that I'm illing
I sip Cristy so I'm pissy
Like a staircase in your building
What?

A thug is what I want
And a thug is what I need
And my friends don't understand
How my baby laces me
A thug is what I want

And my friends don't understand
And I think its jealousy

I'm on it, I-I I'm on it
I blow a hundred million, make another hundred mill bitch
I'm on it, I-I I'm on it
I hustle hard, oh my God
Look at me I'm so rich
I'm on it, I-I I'm on it
My swag on a hundred, Yeah that fly shit I want it quick
I'm on it, I-I I'm on it
I'm always on point man I make niggas so sick

I'm chin chillin, crystal spillin'
Hip hop's villain cause I'm makin' a killin'
Niggas wan' try me, I'm strapped with the lammy
If Jay's illuminati, What am I in my Bugatti?
Ladi dodi, we like to party
Big 4 in the morning, go outside and catch a body
I ball full time nigga this is not a hobby
If you don't know about me, better ask somebody
Yeah, I'm grimey, my wrist so shiny
My Audemar I blew a mill, I'm back to making money
My swag make her want me
Why else would she be on me
I bet she hardly want me? I think she want to blow
Lick me like a lolly, li-lick me like a lolly
Her ass aint all that but her tits like dolly's
Give me that punani, g-g-give me that punani
Now this is motivation make me want more money


I got it, black card in my wallet
Find me on locations with model bitches?
Fly shit I rock it, Tom Ford, exotic
Bitches on my dick now that I moved up out the projects
One for the money, two for the show
I'm ghetto like a muthaf-cker, what you didn't know?
Took threes for my niggas gettin' 8 hundred an O
Kush burn slow, I b-burn dough and sip Merlot like I'm on furlow
Fr-fresh up out the pen, I'm back at it again
Thumpin' like the system in my new big body benz
Look I'm a Fat Joe, my neck glow
The lights hit the ice, its a special effects show
TInkle twinkle little star
No-one here knows who you are
Me I'm so big, notorious you dig
The paper's no problem when ya f-cking with tha kid

Let me know what you think of the Im On It 50 Cent lyrics?

I don't know what you heard about me
But a bitch can't get a dollar out of me
No Cadillac, no perms, you can't see
That I'm a motherfucking P-I-M-P
I don't know what you heard about me
But a bitch can't get a dollar out of me
No Cadillac, no perms, you can't see
That I'm a motherfucking P-I-M-P
Now shorty, she in the club, she dancing for dollars
She got a thing for that Gucci, that Fendi, that Prada
That BCBG, Burberry, Dolce and Gabbana
She feed them foolish fantasies, they pay her cause they want her
I spit a little G, man, and my game got her
A hour later have that ass up in the Ramada
Them trick niggas in her ear saying they think about her
I got the bitch by the bar trying to get a drink up out her
She like my style, she like my smile, she like the way I talk
She from the country, think she like me cause I'm from New York
I ain't that nigga trying to holla cause I want some head
I'm that nigga trying to holla cause I want some bread
I could care less how she perform when she in the bed
Bitch, hit that track, catch a date, and come and pay the kid
Look baby this is simple, you can't see
You fucking with me, you fucking with a P-I-M-P
I don't know what you heard about me
But a bitch can't get a dollar out of me
No Cadillac, no perms, you can't see
That I'm a motherfucking P-I-M-P
I don't know what you heard about me
But a bitch can't get a dollar out of me
No Cadillac, no perms, you can't see
That I'm a motherfucking P-I-M-P
I'm bout my money you see, girl you can holla at me
If you fucking with me, I'm a P-I-M-P
Not what you see on TV, no Cadillac, no greasy
Head full of hair, bitch, I'm a P-I-M-P
Come get money with me if you curious to see
How it feels to be with a P-I-M-P
Roll in the Benz with me, you could watch TV
From the backseat of my V, I'm a P-I-M-P
Girl, we could pop some champagne and we could have a ball
We could toast to the good life, girl, we could have it all
We could really splurge, girl, and tear up the mall
If ever you needed someone I'm the one you should call
I'll be there to pick you up if ever you should fall
If you got problems I can solve 'em, they big or they small
That other nigga you be with ain't 'bout shit
I'm your friend, your father, and confidant, bitch
I don't know what you heard about me
But a bitch can't get a dollar out of me
No Cadillac, no perms, you can't see
That I'm a motherfucking P-I-M-P
I don't know what you heard about me
But a bitch can't get a dollar out of me
No Cadillac, no perms, you can't see
That I'm a motherfucking P-I-M-P
I told you fools before, I stay with the tools
I keep a Benz, some rims, and some jewels
I holla at a ho 'til I got a bitch confused
She got on Payless; me? I got on gator shoes
I'm shopping for chinchillas in the summer, they cheaper
Man, this ho you can have her, when I'm done I ain't gon' keep her
Man, bitches come and go, every nigga pimping know
You saying it's secret, but you ain't gotta keep it on the low
Bitch, choose with me, I'll have you stripping in the street
Put my other hoes down, you get your ass beat
Now Niki my bottom bitch, she always come up with my bread
The last nigga she was with put stitches in her head
Get your ho out of pocket, I'll put a charge on a bitch
Cause I need 4 TVs and AMGs for the six
Ho make a pimp rich, I ain't paying bitch
Catch a date, suck a dick, shit, trick
I don't know what you heard about me
But a bitch can't get a dollar out of me
No Cadillac, no perms, you can't see
That I'm a motherfucking P-I-M-P
I don't know what you heard about me
But a bitch can't get a dollar out of me
No Cadillac, no perms, you can't see
That I'm a motherfucking P-I-M-P
Yeah, in Hollywoood they say "there's no b'ness like show b'ness"
In the hood they say "there's no b'ness like ho b'ness", you know?
They say I talk a little fast, but if you listen a little faster
I ain't got to slow down for you to catch up, bitch
I know you like my style
You like how I break it down
I know you like style
You like how I break it down
I know you like my style
You like how I break it down
Wanna get rich I'll show you how
Wanna get rich I'll show you how
On ya mark, get set, let's go, switch the flow
Teach ya how to turn Yayo into dough
The original don dada, nobody bomb harder
Ya heard what I said boy, I'm hot, I'm hot
The hoodrats they say "He so crazy"
The snitches they say "He tried to spray me"
That's what you get for trying to play me
The aftermath and my wrath is so shady
No matter how you try you can't stop it
I catch ya stunting in the Bentley CoupÃƒÂ© cockpit
If you a pimp why ya hoes stay outta pocket?
Front and find out how my P-40 Glock hit
"50 you need some help?"
Chill, Yayo I got this
Where I'm from the D's tryin' to knock us
They swear to God that it's me selling the choppers
Man, I ain't give them little niggas no product
I know you like my style
But how much do you like my style?
You like how I break it down
Wanna get rich I'll show you how
I know you like my style
But how much do you like my style?
You like how I break it down
Wanna get rich I'll show you how
The birds they say I got a way with words
I be like "baby girl, I like them curves"
If ya not busy tonight then we can swerve
I'mma bachelor, baby, fuck what you heard
From the tellie in ten minutes I'll make you a believer
Tongue touch ya, I'll have ya shakin' like you havin' a seizure
I make hits about what I do in my leisure
G-Unit gang, can't another clique out there see us
Niggas lip sync the lyrics cause they wanna be us
Groupie hoes from the hood they be trying to G us
Trying to holla at the kid every time they see us
Girlfriend quit pretending, I'm the nigga ya love
And I ain't got to say nothing, you know that I'm thugging
Put my hands on that ass and ya say that I'm bugging
We family, baby, kissing cousins
Now look what the riff raff done drug in
For the cheese my degrees is hotter then ya oven
I'mma New Yorker, but I sound Southern
And we sip DP 'till the Don stop bubblin'
After we play, ok, go to ya husband
I know you like my style
But how much do you like my style?
You like how I break it down
Wanna get rich I'll show you how
I know you like my style
But how much do you like my style?
You like how I break it down
Wanna get rich I'll show you how
Em said you gone like my style
Dre said you gone like my style
I said you gone like my style
You gone like how I break it down
You're not really, really ready
The drama will have ya ass in trauma, boy
You're not really, really ready
My knife flip open and then I gets to poking
You're not really, really ready
Them shells start popping and bodies get to dropping
You're not really, really ready
You think ya ready, ya not
Really really ready
The rap game, hip-hop 101
The hardest nine to five you'll ever have
You can't remember shit in no history book
You ready to rap motherfucker?
You ready to sell your soul? hahaha
The rap game will fuck you up
I'ma disrupted nigga, you made me crazy
You shoulda slayed me as a baby
Behavin' shadier than Wes Craven
And you ain't even gotta pay me
I take pleasure of layin' a nigga down daily
You face me, punk it's over, you'll faint fast
I've never fucked up to where I can't whoop ya ass
You'll neck'll get snapped with bare hands, fuck music
Is he rappin'? It's cool but fools, just don't confuse it
 these dudes get rude then I lose it
I'm scandalous, I blow ya two niggas off the atlas
With a gat that's bigger than Godzilla's back nigga
You are not realer, in fact you're feel the effects
Of a crack dealer, why'all presidents since we smacked
And got a mack 10 with it, so I ain't gotta rap
But I'm thankful for that, don't mistakin' me black
'Cause you'll be stankin' in the back of a fuckin' Cadillac
I'ma get snuffed, 'cause I ain't said enough to pipe down
I pipe down, when the White House just wiped out
When I see that little Cheney dike get sniped out
Lights out, bitch adios, goodnight {*gunshot*} (AHH!)
Now put that in ya little pipe and bite down
Think for a minute 'cause the hype just died down
That I won't go up in the Oval Office right now
And flip whatever ain't tied down upside down
I'm all for America, fuck the government
Tell that seed to Laura, tell the slut to suck a dick
Motherfuck ducked, what the fuck? son of a bitch
Take away my gun, I'm gonna tuck some other shit
Can't tell me shit about the tricks of this trade
Switchblade, with a little switch to switch blades
And switch from a six to a sixteen inch blade
Shit's like a samurai sword of Cincy
Shit just don't change to this day
I'm this way, still tell that utslay ipsbay
Upsay my ipnay, 'scuse my ickpay, addelay
But uckfay the rap game

This rap game, this rap game
I ain't sellin' my soul for this rap game
And I ain't diggin' no hole for this rap game
Man, I'm tellin' you, know it ain't happening
This rap game, this rap game
I ain't sellin' my soul for this rap game
I ain't diggin' no hole for this rap game
This rap game, this rap game
I wouldn't want to be drinkin', drowned in my own inequity
But fucked that I'ma rap 'til why'all all get sick of me
And clutch my nuts sack and spit all who pick at me
I'm pickin' a rott mix, fuck the dogs you sic on me
I'm sayin' you motherfuckers don't know us, quit playin'
If I'm broke, then I'm breakin' up in the place where you layin'
You know, same shit every nigga done in his life
I lived to this wise, speak on when I want when I write
So why should I ever fear another man
If he bleed like I bleed, take a piss and he stand?
OK, you win, you can say we can't rap
But no shorts 'cause I'm mean (???) say this is whack
I walk in that party and just start bussin' {*gunshots and screaming*}
Right after I hear the last verse of "Self Destruction"
This liquor makes me want to blast the chrome
To let you know the time without Morris Dangerome (nigga)
I'm low down and shifty, quickly call Swifty
To do a drive-by on the tenth speed with 50
Ya feelin' lucky? Squeeze
I catch you outside of Chuckie Cheese
With ya seed, you be an unlucky G
My lifestyle is unstable, I party anatic
They said no fightin' in the club so I brought me a 'matic
Coughin' the static, I jump niggas, call me a rabbit
Poppin' the tablet and guns to soften (???)

I snatch the chalk from the sidewalk and piss on the curb
This is absurd, we street niggas twistin' the words
We finally could "Say Goodbye to Hollywood"
'cause Proof and Shyne man shit nothin' in common
But ask this band with gasoline chan
We never bow down to be a flash in the pan
No remorse, fuck ya stature dog
Nothin' to do with hands when I clap at why'all
But to draw on the ground with the form and the pound
Then I'm gone outta town 'fore the law come around
So we can battle with raps, we can battle with gats
Matter of fact, we can battle for plaques (This rap game)
I'm too fuckin' retarded
I don't give a fuck about my dick
That's why I'm datin' Lorraina Bobbet
My crew had an argument, who was the largest
Now they all is dead and I roll as a solo artist
Plus I made all the beats and wrote all the raps
Well I really didn't, but I did accordin' to this contract
I was thrown in the snow with nowhere to go
Freezin' 20 below, forced to join (???)
My little girl, she shouldn't listen to these lyrics
That's why I glued her headphones to her ear to make sure she hear it
If rap don't work, I'm startin' a group with Garth Brooks
Hahahaha, and just say "Look"

{To all my fans above 50 Cent
Happy Valentines Day}

It ain't good to good in front of niggas in the hood, right.
It ain't good to good in front of niggas in the hood, right.
Everybody know that

Doin good in front of niggas in the hood cause problems
Tre, trade pounds and (?)

Cause a broke nigga always down to put it in work
Don't run up on me, I don't know you nigga
So what you bought my cd, I don't owe you nigga
I know you love the way the goutti beat bump
Got you license plate rounds and all over your trunk
Don't confuse these trucks with my style dog
I'm from Queens but I'm mother fuckin B.K. hard
I sound like I move bricks uptown
More like a thug from the Bronx who stay with a 4 pound
Shook nigga (shook nigga, shook nigga)
I'm a Guiness Book nigga

We don't play that pussy shit round here
You can get your fuckin wig split down here
Don't rep where you come from too much around here
You can get your fuckin cap filt

If I can't get my gun in the club, why whould I come in the club
So them niggas I done stuck up could cut me he fuck up, nah
I'm outside to jump off in a benz jeep
4 deep strapped with all kinds of heat
Niggas think they want beef
They don't want beef
They find from somebody that love playin in the street
When you rap, keep it gangsta dog it's all good
Just don't go coppin that shyt in the wrong hood
But I'm from the young boy, come and try ya nigga
Shell will make ya feel like your on fire nigga
If you thinkin we thristy 'cause, we right
We lookin at your watch and chain like that's a S-type
Murder sayin don't play 50 in the club
Last time it came nigga tore the shyt up (what)
I don't where you from and I don't care
But nigga we don't play that pussy shit round here



No ingles, No ingles, mother fuckers will shoot ya
The Latin Kings don't like me, I don't care
We don't talk that mida mida bullshit round here
Man, I done so much dirt in the hood
Niggas heard I got shot they was all sayin good (do it for em)
Fuck ya'll, ya aint got to like me

I'm on the same bullshit I been on
It's the same bullshit ya niggas need to get on
Ya shit sound too commercial
Come cruisin through the hood mother fuckers will hurt ya
You shouldn't them flash jewels
Cause niggas will run up on ya if thats true
They want your money, the watch, and you tenis shos
I aint gotta tell ya not to move
Ya know the rules
Yea, It's 50, A.K.A. Ferrari, F-50, break it down
I got a lot of living, to do before I die,
And I ain't got time to waste. Let's make it
You say you a gangsta, but you never pop nothing
We say you a wanksta, then you need to stop fronting
You ain't a friend of mine,(yea) you ain't no kin to mine,(c'mon)
What makes you think that I won't run up on you wit the nine, (uh huh)

So hurry up and cop and go resell it nicks and dimes, (uh huh)
Shortie, she so fine, I gotta make her mine,
A ass like that, gotta be one of a kind,(Whoo)
I crush em every time, punch em wit every line
I'm fucking with they mind, I make em press rewind
They know they can't shine, If I'm around to rhyme
Been on parole since ninety four, cause I commit the crime
I say them my line, I did it three to nine
The D's ran up in my crib, you know who drop the dime
You say you a gangsta, but you never pop nothing,
You say you a wanksta, then you need to stop fronting
You go to the dealership, but you don't never cop nothing
You been hustling a long time, but you ain't got nothing
You say you a gangsta, but you never pop nothing
You say you a wanksta, then you need to stop fronting
You go to the dealership, but you never cop nothing
You been hustling long time, but you ain't got nothing
Damn homie,

Me, I'm not wanksta, me, I'm no actor
But it's me you see, on your TV, cause I hustle babe
This rap shit is so easy, I'm getting what you get for a brick, to talk greasy
By any means, partner, I got to eat on these streets
When you play me close, fa' sure, I'ma pop my heat
Niggas say they goin' murder 50, how
We riding round wit guns the size, of Lil' Bow Wow
What you know about AK's and are-15's
Equipped wit night vision, shell catchers and empties, huh
You say you a gangsta, but you never pop nothing,
You say you a wanksta, then you need to stop fronting
You go to the dealership, but you don't never cop nothing
You been hustling a long time, but you ain't got nothing

Damn homie!
Unh, yeah, I like the way this feel right here
yo, turn me up in the head phones just a lil' bit
yeah
There ain't shit in this world deeper than loyalty and love

For you, I pull up in the whip and spray the whole strip

For you, there ain't a damn thing that I won't do
I'm a thug, this my way I show, my love for you

For you, if we go broke, we gon' rob a nigga ass
(For you, if we get knocked, I'ma have to take the weight
'Cause with a record like yours dog, you ain't stayin' upstate)
Nigga for you, I kill a whole God damn crew (Why?)
'Cause I know you'd do the same thing too, haha
I ride, you ride for me, my enemies your enemies
How could you not love a thug like me?
Would you ride for me? (you ain't even got to ask)
Would you die for me? (nigga, they blast you, they blast me)
Would you cry for me? (shit, when I die I don't cry for me, just keep reppin' Southside for me)
Nigga, you ride for me? (you ain't even got to ask)
Would you die for me? (nigga, they blast you, they blast me)
Would you cry for me? (shit, when I die I don't cry for me, just keep reppin' Southside for me)
Nigga, I'm the stem, you the crack
I'm the clip, you the gat
I'm the glock, you the mac
I'm the artist, you the trap
I'm a pen, you the pad
I'm the Dutch, you the bag
I'm the knife, you the stab
I'm the driver, you the Jag
I'm the ice, you the bezel
I'm grimy, you ghetto
I'm the bow, you the arrow
I'm the shell, you the barrel
I'm a pimp, you a player
I'm dope, you the hustler
I'm a nine, quiet me down, you the muffler
Would you ride for me? (you ain't even got to ask)
Would you die for me? (nigga, they blast you, they blast me)

Would you cry for me? (shit, when I die I don't cry for me, just keep reppin' Southside for me)
You can catch me in public housing, wit' bundles of D
Or in the Santa Monica mountains, bundled up to ski
Since, time is money, I rhyme on the clock
And walk through the strip with a nine in the ox
You seen the ice, you know it's top notch
And when it comes to dice, I'm seeing' shorty to the shot box
Banks stop, guns pop through your tank top
And leave you wet up like a sonar range drop
When I grind, I wear the same thing tomorrow
When you grind, it's Showtime at the Apollo
Damn near every rapper gotta hide sixteen
Well my flow's like a ho that's sixteen
I ran through niggas, dismantled niggas
They mad 'cause they see me in Cancun bitches
But I'm ghetto, straight from the 'hood my nigga
If there's no toothbrush I'ma use my finger
I got so many minks, and so many leathers
The crib is surrounded by animal protesters
I'm a grown man, still livin' like I'm young
With the mind of an old man, full of wisdom
Here the cops come, task force van
Rock so much ice, I'm called Jack Frost man
And while we sippin' on cris', you sippin' backwash man
Your team got heart, but your heart's in my hand
You want sixteen bars, in song format
Or sixteen cars on your mom's doormat, what
Go, go, go, go go, go, go, shawty
It's your birthday
We gon' party like it's yo birthday
We gon' sip Bacardi like it's your birthday
And you know we don't give a fuck
It's not your birthday!

If you watch how I move you'll mistake me for a player or pimp
Been hit wit a few shells but I don't walk wit a limp
In the hood then the ladies saying "50 you hot"
They like me, I want them to love me like they love 'Pac
But holla in New York them niggas'll tell ya I'm loco
And the plan is to put the rap game in a choke hold

What up, Blood? (What?)

What up, Blood? (What?)
What up, gangsta?
What up, Blood? (What?)
What up, Cuz? (What?)

They say I walk around like got an S on my chest
Naw, that's a semi-auto, and a vest on my chest
I try not to say nothing, the DA might want to play in court
But I'll hunt or duck a nigga down, like it's a sport
Front on me, I'll cut ya gun-butt ya or bump ya
You getting money? I can't get none with ya, then fuck ya
I'm not the type to get knocked for D.W.I
I'm the type that'll kill your connect when the coke price rise
Gangstas, they bump my shit, them they know me
I grew up around some niggas that's not my homies
Hundred G's I stash it (what) the mack I blast it (yeah)
D's come we dump the diesel and battery acid
This flow's been mastered, the ice I flash it
Jux me, I'll have your mama picking out your casket, bastard
I'm on the next level, Breitling baguette bezel
Benz pedal to the metal, hotter than a tea kettle, blood (what)
What up, Blood? (What?)
What up, Cuz? (What?)
What up, Blood? (What?)
What up, gangsta?
What up, Blood? (What?)
What up, Cuz? (What?)

We don't play that
We don't play that
We don't play that (G-Unit)
We don't play around
I sit back, twist the best bud, burn and wonder
When gangstas bump my shit, can they hear my hunger?
When the 5th kick, duck quick, it sounds like thunder
In December I'll make your block feel like summer
The rap critics say I can rhyme
The fiends say my dope is a nine, every chick I fuck with is a dime
I'm like Patti LaBelle, homie, I'm on my own
Where I lay my hat is my home, I'm a rolling stone
Cross my path I'll crush ya, thinking I won't touch ya
I'll have your ass using a wheelchair, cane or crutches
Industry hoes fuck us, in the hood they love us
Stomp a bone out your ass with some brand new Chuckers
What up, Blood? (What?)
What up, Cuz? (What?)
What up, Blood? (What?)
What up, gangsta?
What up, Blood? (What?)
What up, Cuz? (What?)

Hey, you wanna hit this shit?
It's that green tongue, Cali bud
I don't need Dom Perignon, I don't need Cris
Tanqueray and Alize, I don't need shit
Nigga, I'm high all the time, I smoke that good shit
I stay high all the time, man, I'm on some hood shit
Give me some dro, purple haze and some chocolate
Give me a dutch and a lighter, I'll spark shit
And stay high all the time, I smoke that good shit
I'm high all the time, man, I'm on some hood shit
Every time I roll up niggas holla roll up
And I tell 'em hold up, you ain't getting money you ain't smoking
In my Benzo, 20 inch Lorenzo's
Smoking on indo, high as a motherfucker
I be on them backstreets, niggas know I clap heat
Only if you got beef, man ,you better holla at me
Niggas get locked up, stabbed up, shot up
Every time I pop up, a lot going on in my hood
I shoot the dice, I holla get 'em girls
Daddy need new shoes, daddy need Pirellis to look mean on 22's
Stash box, Xbox, laptop, fax machine, phone
Bulletproof this bitch and I'm gone
2003 Suburban swerving, too many sips of Henny
The D's sick, they searched the whip and they can't find the semi's
They was just harassing me cause they know who I was
Spent the night in Central Booking for smoking some bud
I don't need Dom Perignon, I don't need Cris
Tanqueray and Alize, I don't need shit
Nigga, I'm high all the time, I smoke that good shit
I stay high all the time, man, I'm on some hood shit
Give me some dro, purple haze and some chocolate
Give me a dutch and a lighter, I'll spark shit
And stay high all the time, I smoke that good shit
I'm high all the time, man, I'm on some hood shit
Now if you heard I done started some shit
It ain't because I be high, be high
And if you heard I done let off a clip
It ain't because I be high, be high
But I twist that lye, lye lye lye
I get high as I wanna, nigga
Go against me, for sure, you's a goner, nigga
I don't smoke to calm my nerves, but I got beef
Finna crush my enemies like I crush the hashish
If you love me tell me you love me, don't stare at me, man
I'd hate to be in the pen for clapping one of my fans
Let me show you how to greet me when you meet me, when you see me
If you real, my nigga, you know how to holla "G-Unit"
There's no competition, it's just me
50 Cent, motherfucker, I'm hot on these streets
If David could go against Goliath with a stone
I can go at Nas and Jigga, both for the throne
I don't need Dom Perignon, I don't need Cris
Tanqueray and Alize, I don't need shit
Nigga, I'm high all the time, I smoke that good shit
I stay high all the time, man, I'm on some hood shit
Give me some dro, purple haze and some chocolate
Give me a dutch and a lighter, I'll spark shit
And stay high all the time, I smoke that good shit
I'm high all the time, man, I'm on some hood shit
Now who you know besides me who write lines and squeeze nines
And have hoes in the hood sniffing on white lines
You don't want me to be your kid's role model
I'll teach them how to buck them 380's and load up them hollows
Have shorty fresh off the stoop ready to shoot
Big blunt in his mouth, deuce-deuce in his boot
Sit in the crib sipping Guinness watching Menace
Then oh Lord, have a young nigga bucking shit like he O-Dog
My team they depend on me when it's crunch time
I eat a nigga food in broad day like it's lunchtime
You feeling brave, nigga, go ahead get gully
See if I won't leave your brains leaking up out your skully
I done made myself hot so ain't shit you can tell me
Now niggas calling me to feature, man, fuck your money
I ain't hurting, I'm aight, nigga, I'm doing good
I ain't gotta write rhymes, I got bricks in the hood
I don't need Dom Perignon, I don't need Cris
Tanqueray and Alize, I don't need shit
Nigga, I'm high all the time, I smoke that good shit
I stay high all the time, man, I'm on some hood shit
Give me some dro, purple haze and some chocolate
Give me a dutch and a lighter, I'll spark shit
And stay high all the time, I smoke that good shit
I'm high all the time, man, I'm on some hood shit
G-Unit, are you ready? G-Unit, are you ready?

It's easy to see when you look at me
If you look closely 50 don't back down
Everywhere I go both coasts with toast
Eastside, Westside, I hold that mack down
Every little nigga you see around me
Hold a gun big enough to fucking hold Shaq down
Next time you in the hood and see an O.G
You ask about me, the young boy don't back down
Any living thing that cannot co-exist with the kid
Must decease existing, little nigga, now listen
Your mami, your papi, that bitch you chasin'
Your little dirty ass kids, I'll fucking erase them
Your success is not enough, you wanna be hard
Knowing that you get knocked you get fucked in the yard
You's a Pop Tart, sweetheart, you soft in the middle
I eat ya for breakfast, the watch was an exchange for your necklace
And your boss is a bitch, if he could he would
Sell his soul for cheap, trade his life to be Suge
You can buy cars, but you can't buy respect in the hood
Maybe I'm so disrespectful cause to me you're a mystery
I know niggas from ya hood, you have no history
Never poked nothing, never popped nothing, nigga stop fronting
Jay put you on, X made you hot
Now you run around like you some big shot
Ha ha, pussy
It's easy to see when you look at me
If you look closely 50 don't back down
Everywhere I go both coasts with toast
Eastside, Westside, I hold that mack down
Every little nigga you see around me
Hold a gun big enough to fucking hold Shaq down
Next time you in the hood and see an O.G
You ask about me, the young boy don't back down
"The rap game is all fucked up now, what are we gonna do now?
How we gonna eat man? 50 back around"
That's Ja's little punk ass thinking out loud
Southside 'til I die, that's just how I get down
I'm back in the game, shawty, to rule and conquer
You sing for hoes and sound like the cookie monster
I'm the hardest from New York, my flow is bonkers
All the other hard niggas they come from Yonkers
It's been years and you had the same niggas in the background
You never gonna sell Mitsubishi Tah, Crack Child
Them niggas dead, they just suck, they no good
I ain't never heard a nigga say they like them in the hood
I'm back better than ever on top of my game
Even them country boys saying "50 we feeling you, mane"
Now you stay the fuck outta my zone, outta my throne
I'm New York City's own bad guy
It's easy to see when you look at me
If you look closely 50 don't back down
Everywhere I go both coasts with toast
Eastside, Westside, I hold that mack down
Every little nigga you see around me
Hold a gun big enough to fucking hold Shaq down
Next time you in the hood and see an O.G
You ask about me, the young boy don't back down
I ain't telling anyone you pussy
I ain't telling anyone you getting extorted
I've been patently waiting to blow
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to "The 50 Cent Show"
This is my life, my pain, my night, my gun
Now that I'm back, you can't sleep, I'm a nightmare, huh?
You hired cops to hold you down cause you fear for your life
But you heard about them guns I done bought, right?
I ain't going nowhere, I done told you, nigga
I'm a G-Unit motherfucking soldier, nigga

I know, I know
Oh no, he didn't say anything about Ja
Okay? Ja is my boo, okay? Jeffrey Atkins ain't never hurt nobody
And y'all know big thangs come in small packages, holla
Now everythang was cool until 50 Cent came back into the picture
They better not put their hands on Jeffrey
Okay, first of all, they don't know that I am a 12 degree pink belt
Okay, I will dice his ass up like a little piece of celery
Okay, cause see, they don't know me, Delicious, do they know me?
Okay, I though so
Cause you know that I know karate, and I will see him
And I will Jet Li his ass, hitaaaah!
G-Unit, UTP
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha
G-Unit, UTP, G-Unit, UTP
G-Unit, UTP, 50 Cent, get 'em Buck, man
50 Cent, that's my name, man I ain't fucking playing
I move on you with that Mac, mane
Come off that watch and chain 'fore I blow out your brains
Shells hit your chest, go out your back, mane
See me I put in work, man, I been doing dirt for so long
Then niggas get laid out
Niggas run through my crib to holla at the kid
That's when I start bringing them thangs out
Then we go through the strip hanging up out the whip
Dumping clips off at their whole clique, mane
When witnesses around they know how we get down
So when the cops come they ain't see shit, mane
My soldiers slanging 'caine, sunny, snowy, sleet or rain
Come through the hood and you can cop that
I'm sittig' on some change, G-Unit that's the gang
Come through here stunting you get popped at
I love to pump crack, love to stay strapped
Love to squeeze gats, but you don't hear me though
I love to hit the block, I love my two Glocks
Love to bust shots, but you don't hear me though
I love to pump crack, love to stay strapped
Love to squeeze gats, but you don't hear me though
I love to hit the block, I love my two Glocks
Love to bust shots, but you don't hear me though
I came in this game knowing niggas gon' hate me
Just for the simple fact they know that I'm a rider
I got a hell of a aim, I keep on telling you, mane
I swear ain't nobody gon' find ya
When I get lifted I'm tempted to tear your block up
Your niggas can't run cause I'm behind ya
Me and Chili in your city with a couple nine-milli's
You better stay in line, bro
Cause if I walk it I'll talk it, you know we'll walk up and pop it
I love the sound of gunfire, bro
Right now we smacking 'em with platinum
And they hate it cause we made it, that's what we keep that iron for
I represent it cause I'm in it, UTP until I'm finished
Juvenile, they can't stop us and I admit it I live it
I'll knock a baller off his pivot with this motherfucking chopper
I love to pump crack, love to stay strapped
Love to squeeze gats, but you don't hear me though
I love to hit the block, I love my two Glocks
Love to bust shots, but you don't hear me though
I love to pump crack, love to stay strapped
Love to squeeze gats, but you don't hear me though
I love to hit the block, I love my two Glocks
Love to bust shots, but you don't hear me though
My twenty-inches spinning, you always see me grinning
And you hear niggas call me grimy
They hit me with them bricks and I ain't pay 'em shit
I'm outta town, they can't find me
When I come back around, man, I'mma back 'em down
I run up busting that TEC, mane
If you ain't got a gun and you can't fucking run
My advice is you hit the deck, mane
But if you get away and come back another day
My soldiers'll leave you wet, mane
Cause we know where you be and we know where you stay
And we'll come checking through your set, mane
Man, you heard what I said, now get it in your head
I ain't paying no fucking debt, mane
Cause you's a middle man, what you don't understand?
You's a fucking fake ass connect, mane
I love to pump crack, love to stay strapped
Love to squeeze gats, but you don't hear me though
I love to hit the block, I love my two Glocks
Love to bust shots, but you don't hear me though
I love to pump crack, love to stay strapped
Love to squeeze gats, but you don't hear me though
I love to hit the block, I love my two Glocks
Love to bust shots, but you don't hear me though
New York City!
You are now rapping, with 50 Cent
You gotta love it,
I just wanna chill and twist a lot
Catch suns in my 7-45
You drive me crazy shorty I
Need to see you and feel you next to me
I provide everything you need and I
Like your smile I don't wanna see you cry
Got some questions that I got to ask and I
Hope you can come up with the answers babe
Girl, It's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?
Girl, It's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me girl?
If I fell off tomorrow would you still love me?
If I didn't smell so good would you still hug me?
If I got locked up and sentenced to a quarter century,
Could I count on you to be there to support me mentally?
If I went back to a hoopty from a Benz, would you poof and disappear like
Some of my friends?
If I was hit and I was hurt would you be by my side?
If it was time to put in work would you be down to ride?
I'd get out and peel a nigga cap and chill and drive
I'm asking questions to find out how you feel inside
If I ain't rap 'cause I flipped burgers at Burger King
Would you be ashamed to tell your friends you feelin' me?
In the bed if I used my tongue would you like that?
If I wrote you a love letter would you write back?
Now we can have a lil' drink you know a nightcap
And we could go do what you like, I know you like that
Girl, It's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?
Girl, It's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me girl?
Now would you leave me if you're father found out I was thuggin'?
Do you believe me when I tell you, you the one I'm loving?
Are you mad 'cause I'm asking you 21 questions?
Are you my soul mate? 'Cause if so, girl you a blessing
Do you trust me enough, to tell me your dreams?
I'm staring at ya' trying to figure how you got in them jeans
If I was down would you say things to make me smile?
I treat you how you want to be treated just teach me how
If I was with some other chick and someone happened to see?
And when you asked me about it I said it wasn't me
Would you believe me? Or up and leave me?
How deep is our bond if that's all it takes for you to be gone?
We only humans girl we make mistakes, to make it up I do whatever it take
I love you like a fat kid love cake
You know my style I say anything to make you smile
Girl, It's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?
Girl, It's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me girl?
Could you love me in a Bentley?
Could you love me on a bus?
I'll ask 21 questions, and they all about us
Could you love me in a Bentley?
Could you love me on a bus?
I'll ask 21 questions, and they all about us
Yea, ha ha, yea, yea
If I can't do it, homey, it can't be done
Now I'ma let the champagne bottle pop
I'ma take it to the top
For sure I'ma make it hot, baby (baby)
I apply pressure to pussies that stunting I pop
Stand alone squeezing my pistol I'm sure that I gotta
Now Peter Piper picked peppers and don't rock rhymes
I'm 50 Cent, I write a lil bit but I pop nines
Tell niggas, "Get they money right," 'cause I got mine
And I'm around quit playing nigga you can't shine
You goin' be that next chump to end up in the trunk
After being hit by the pump, is that what you want?
Be easy nigga, I'll lay your ass out
Believe me nigga, that's what I'm about, gangsta
You could find a nigga sitting on chrome
Hit the clutch, hit the gear, hit the gas & I'm gone (Yea!)
If I can't do it, homey, it can't be done
Now I'ma let the champagne bottle pop
I'ma take it to the top
For sure I'ma make it hot, baby (baby)
I'm down for the action, he smart with his mouth so smack em
You holding a strap, he might come back so clap em
React like a gangsta, die like a gangsta for acting
'Cause you'll get hit and homicide'll be asking, "What happened?"
OH NO look who clapped em with the fo' fo'
20 inch rims sitting chrome!
Eastside, Westside niggas OH NO, NO GO
Even my mama said, "Something really wrong with my brain"
Niggas don't rob me they know I'm down to die for my chain
G-UNIT! We get it popping in the hood
G-UNIT! Motherfucker whats good?
I'm waiting on niggas to act like they don't know how to act
I had a sip of too much Jack, I'll blow em off the map
With the mack, thinking its all rap
Til that ass get clapped and Doc say "It's a wrap"

If I can't do it, homey, it can't be done
Now I'ma let the champagne bottle pop
I'ma take it to the top
For sure I'ma make it hot, baby (baby)
I been feeling I had to teach lessons to slow learners
Go head act up, get smacked in the head with the burner
I don't fight fair, I'm dirty-dirty
I'm from Southside Jamaica, Queens, nigga ya heard me?
When streetlights come on niggas blast the nines
Get locked up, they read books to pass the time
In the game there's up's and down's, so I stay on the grind
Niggas on my dick more than my bitch, I stay on they mind
They ain't nothing they could do to stop my shine
This is God's plan homey, this ain't mine
I played the music loud so Grandpa called me a nuisance
And Grandma, who always gotta throw in her two cent
I'm the drop out who made more more money than these teachers
Roofless like the Coupe but I come with more features
I am what I am, you could like it or love it
It feels good to pull 50 grand & think nothing of it
Fuck it
If I can't do it, homey, it can't be done
Now I'ma let the champagne bottle pop
I'ma take it to the top
For sure I'ma make it hot, baby (baby)
If I can't do it, homey, it can't be done
Now I'ma let the champagne bottle pop
I'ma take it to the top
For sure I'ma make it hot, baby (baby)

From Southside Queens to Inglewood
We representin' like we should
I'm hot boy, I told you before
Got that Benz and that Hummer off the showroom floor
I know you hate it when I pop up, wrist all rocked up
In The 'hood, empty niggas locked up, they rats all knocked up
Baby after baby, the 'hood is crazy
Niggas'll set you up and wet you up, trust me they shady
Got a pet bulldog, I keep under my linen
It don't bark, they spark when the revolver spinnin'
We winnin'
I still be riding through the 'hood
Into Compton, it's all good
From Southside Queens to Inglewood
We representin' like we should
Hold up, hold up, get a good look at my rims
God damn, look at them twenty-fours diamonds spin
Now the D's, they harass me in the 'hood
A few times, niggas try to blast me in the 'hood
Fuck it's all good
Catch me in the coupe - on the lean
Wit' needles and samples and diesels for the fiends
The money stay on my mind, so I stay on the grind
Plus niggas like to stun, so I stay wit' my nine
I ain't the type nigga that be out, runnin' his mouth
Talkin' gangsta and shit, with my gun in the house
Now homie, you better get to know me better
Before you be bleedin' pints of blood into Iceberg sweater
When the tails come flyin' up out the beretta
You gon' feel like it's yo' fault and say 'Man I knew better'
Look dogg, I don't play that shit
I pull that thing out I'ma spray that shit
That how I get down
Brooklyn she's so sick in the hood
Got these fat bitches get the spit in the hood
'Cause I throw diamonds, shot that fifth in the hood
That's what you get for talkin' all that shit in the hood
Yeah I'm still a minor, remember this
Everything Brooklyn choppy broads still behind ya
Brooklyn to Compton it's all good
Get robbed, get shot, shit is poppin' in the hood
I still be riding through the 'hood
Into Compton, it's all good
From Southside Queens to Inglewood
We representin' like we should
I still be riding through the 'hood
Into Compton, it's all good

NYPD, LAPD, NYPD (That's your motherfuckin' click, huh?)
NYPD, LAPD, NYPD (You a motherfuckin' snitch, huh?)
NYPD, LAPD, NYPD

Niggaz wanna shine like me (me), rhyme like me (me)
Then walk around with a 9 like me (me)
They don't wanna do it, 3 to 9 like me
And they ain't strong enough to take 9 like me
Aiyoo, you think about shittin' on 50... save it
My songs belong in the Bible with King David
I teach niggaz sign language, that ain't def son
*click* *click* you heard that? That mean RUN
Ask around, I ain't the one you wanna stun on, pa
Pull through, I'll throw a fuckin cocktail at ya' car
From the last shootout, I got a demple on my face
It's nothin', I could go after Mase's fanbase
Shell hit my jaw, I ain't wait for doctor to get it out
Hit my wisdom tooth *huck-too* spit it out
I don't smile a lot, cause ain't nothin' pretty
Got a purple heart for war, and I ain't never left the City
Hos be like "Fitty, you so witty"
On the dick like they heard I ghostwrite for P.Diddy
You got fat while we starve, it's my turn
I done felt how the shells burn, I still won't learn
Won't learn

If you get shot and run to the cop - You not like me
You ain't got no work on the block - You not like me
It's hot, you ain't got no drop - You not like me
Like me duke, you not like me

Moma said..
Everything that happened to us, was part of God's plan
So at night when I talk him, I got my gun in my hand
Don't think I'm crazy, cause I don't fear man
Cause I feel when I kill a man, God won't understand
I got a head full of evil thoughts, am I Satan
I been coulda killed these niggaz, I'm still waitin
In the telly with to whores, a Benz with to doors
32 carrots in the traws, no flaws
You see me in the hood, I got atleast two guns
I carry the glock, Tony carry my M-1s
Hold me down nigga, OGs tryin' to rock me
D's waitin for my response to lock me
This is my hustle, nigga don't knock me
You need some shit with banana clips to try and stop me
I'M THE ONE

If you get shot and run to the cop - You not like me
You ain't got no work on the block - You not like me
It's hot, you ain't got no drop - You not like me
Like me duke, you not like me

See, I done been to the Pearly Gates, they sent me back
The good die young, I ain't eligable for that
I shot niggaz, I been shot, sold crack in the street
My attitude is gangsta, so I stand some beef
You wanna get acquainted with me, you wanna know me
From 3 point range, with a glock, I shoot better then Kobe
See a nigga standin' next to me, he probably my Co-D
See a bitch gettin in my whip, she probably gon' blow me
See the flow is like a 38, it's special yoooooo
A country boy tell ya, I'm fittin' to blowwwww
I'm more like a pimp, then a trick, you knowwww
See, I'm in this for the paper, I don't love the hooos
Niggaz broke in the hood, worried about mines
Grown ass men, wearin starter piece shines
You know them little pieces, with the little stones
Got little clientele fiends call your cell phones
When the gossip starts, I'm always the topic
You too old for that shit dog, why don't you stop it
Shorty, I been watchin you watchin me
Now tell me what you like more, my watch or me
Haha

If you get shot and run to the cop - You not like me
You ain't got no work on the block - You not like me
It's hot, you ain't got no drop - You not like me
Like me duke, you not like me
*Ad-libing to the end*
Hey Em, you know you my favorite white boy right?
I owe you for this one
I've been patiently waiting for a track to explode on
You can stun if you want and your ass will get rolled on
It feels like my flows been hot for so long
If you thinking I'm fucking fall off your so wrong
Innocent in my head, like a baby born dead
Destination heaven, sit and politic with passengers from nine eleven
The lords blessings leave me lyrically inclined
Shit I ain't even gotta try to shine
God's the seamstress that tailor fitted my pain
I got scriptures in my brain I could spit at your dame
Straight out the good book, look, niggas is shook
50 fears no man, warrior swing swords like Conan
Picture me pen in hand write lines knowing the source'll quote it
When I die, they'll read this and say a genius wrote it
I grew up without my pops should that make me bitter?
I caught cases I copped out does that make me a quitter?
In this white man's world I'm similar to a squirrel
Lookin for a slut with a nice butt to get a nut
If I get shot today my phone will stop ringing again
These industry niggaz ain't friends, they know how to pretend
Patiently waiting to make it through all the hating
Debating whether or not you could even weather the storm.
Just lay on the table they operating to save you
Its like an angel came to you sent from the heavens above
They think they're crazy but they ain't crazy lets face it, shit basically
They just playing sick, they ain't shit They ain't saying shit, spray 'em Fifty
A to the K, get in the way I'll bring Dre and them wit me
And turn this day into fucking mayhem you staying with me?
Don't let me lose you, I'm not trying to confuse you
When I let loose with this Uzi and just shoot through your Isuzu
You get the message am I getting through to you?
You know whats coming you motherfuckers don't even know do you?
Take some Big and some Pac and you mix them up in a pot
Sprinkle a little Big L on top, and what the fuck do you got?
You got the realest and illest killers tied up in a knot
The Juggernauts of this rap shit like it or not
Its like a fight to the top just to see who died for the spot
You put your life in this, nothing like surviving the shot
Y'all know what time it is as soon as Fifty signs on this dot
Shit what you know about death threats, 'cause I get a lot
Shady Records was eighty seconds away from the towers
Some cowards fucked with the wrong building they meant to hit ours
Better evacuate all children - nuclear shower
There's nothing spookier, you're now about to witness the power of fuckin Fifty
I've been patiently waiting for a track to explode on
You can stun if you want and your ass will get rolled on
It feels like my flows been hot for so long
If you thinking I'm fucking fall off your so wrong
I've been patiently waiting for a track to explode on
You can stun if you want and your ass will get rolled on
It feels like my flows been hot for so long
If you thinking I'm fucking fall off your so wrong
The guns spark when the shots go off
Its fifty, they say its Fifty
See a nigga laid out with his fucking top blown off
Its fifty, man that wasn't Fifty, they don't holla my name
You shouldn't throw stones if you live in a glass house
And if you got a glass jaw, you should watch your mouth
Cause I'll break your face, have your ass running
Mumbling to the Jake, you going against me dog you making a mistake
Ill split you have you looking like the Michael Jackson's jackets with all them zippers
I'm the boss on this boat, you can call me skipper
The way I turn the money over you should call me flipper
Your bitch, a regular bitch, you calling her wifey
I fucked her, I feed her fast food, you keeping her icy
I'm down to sell records but not my soul
Snoop said this in 94' "We don't love them hoes"
I got pennies for my thoughts, now I'm rich
See the twenty's spinning looking mean on the six
Niggas wearing flags, 'cause the colors match they clothes
They get caught in the wrong hood and get filled up with holes (motherfucker).
I've been patiently waiting for a track to explode on
You can stun if you want and your ass will get rolled on
It feels like my flows been hot for so long
If you thinking I'm fucking fall off your so wrong
I've been patiently waiting for a track to explode on
You can stun if you want and your ass will get rolled on
It feels like my flows been hot for so long
If you thinking I'm fucking fall off your so wrong
Its fifty
Yeah, 50 Cent, Lloyd Banks, Tony Yayo
G-Unit
This rap shit plays a major part of my life
So if you jeapordize it I got the right
To send a mothafucka at you tonight
G-Unit, and I ain't stoppin' to my clique poppin'
Swimmin' in barrels of money
Ma could walk around wit' a head up
And challenge you dummy
It's funny, niggaz rather see you sufferin' and hungry
I'm hungry as hell, skatin' with another nigga's money
You lyin' your ass off, you know you ain't that tough
I'm pullin' your mask off as soon as you act up
You know what I came for, it isn't the game ball
artillery that's about as long as a chainsaw

I'm wide awake, but it still feels like I'm dreamin'
Forty Cal under my pillow, condom feelin' my semen
The physical presence of a female, form of a demon
That's why, I fuck 'em and leave 'em
Get my nut while I'm breathin'
'Cause they thought they'd catch me slippin'
Now I'm duckin' and trippin'
That's a thousand dollar outfit what the fuck is you rippin'?
You trippin', more records could get my ass in position
Death wish for no religion whether Catholic or Christian
Listen, I went through, mama bitchin' in and out the kitchen
With probable cause, papa was in and out of prison
You got soldiers, but you still gotta respect ours
We got more four five's and nines than a deck of cards
You can take me out the 'hood, but can't take the 'hood out me

'Cause I'm ghetto, I'm ghetto
Niggaz hate when you do good
But when you broke, your friends and your enemies
They love you, they love you
"Chi Chi, get the llello"
Picture me being crack, out of town, trips on the trail
"Chi Chi, get the llello"
Picture me being crack

You can sift me, cut me, I'll turn you to a junkie
I'm the number one seller in the whole fuckin' country
Wallstreet niggaz, they cop me on the low
White boys don't call me coke, they call me blow
It's time to go, on the bus, the train, the plane
I'll smuggle, I'm nothin' but trouble
I'll make your money double
Cook me in baking soda
I'll turn your Hooprock into a new Range Rover
I'll pay all your bills and fill your 'frigerator
Feed your family, turn your man to a hater
Put me in your doorpanels or your stashbox
Put me in your Nik's, Timbs or Reeboks
If you cop three and a half you hustlin' backwards
Cop a hundred grams
You movin' forwards
You tryin' to move more birds
In PA all day, on the corner of Third
You can take me out the 'hood
But can't take the 'hood out me

'Cause I'm ghetto, I'm ghetto
Picture me polishin' pistols, I'm comin' to get you
The shells hit you, you screamin'
Think I'm playin'? I mean it
Man, I done bought all these pistols
Let's get it poppin'
Start wavin' my emboies shell cases get the droppin'

Like if it's down the corner, I got too much pride to hide
I'm outside, gun in my pocket just stunnin', I'm stoppin'
I'm dyin' to pop it, I'm young and I'm restless
You know my contestants
As the world turns, there's lessons to be learned
Count all my blessin's, clean up my weapons
I'm ready for war, the strong survive, the weak will parish
I told you before, hoes they compliment me now like "50 nice chain"
Belagio, twenty grand in chips at a dice game
Burn out, can't stop gotta watch MTV, BET
Nigga you see me
I wonder if you mad, 'cause I'm doin' good
Or 'cause niggaz feelin' me more than you in your own 'hood
And it hurts 'cause you love 'em and they don't love you back
'Cause they know you just rappin' and you don't bust a gat
You pussy, yeah, explain it to niggaz in your hood nigga
They know you fuckin' frontin' nigga
Talkin' like gangstas on a record, I see you nigga
Niggaz know me nigga, ask around in my 'hood nigga
Read the "Daily News" nigga
You see them talkin' about me nigga
I'm in the middle of all kinds of shit
Pussy, let's get it poppin'
G-G-Unit, G-G-Unit, G-G-G-Unit

I gotta make it to heaven, for going through hell
Gotta make it to heaven, gotta make it to heaven
I gotta make it to heaven, for going through hell
Gotta make it to heaven I hope I make it to heaven
Some say I'm paranoid I say I'm careful how I choose my friends
Been to ICU once I ain't going again
First Zee got murked, then Raw got murked
An homies still in the hood, why he ain't getting hurt
I smell somethin' fishy man it might be a rat
Damn niggas switching sides on niggas just like that
You know me, I stay wit a bitch on her knees
An get guns away in the hood like government cheese
Spray on Suzuki's eleven hundred cc's
More plate on the back, straight squeezing a Mak
In the hood they identify niggas by they cars
So I switch up whips to stay off the radar
I ain't gotta be around to make shit hot
I send Yayo to dump 30 shots on ya block
So spray that Tec nigga if I say get it done
An make it wet niggas if you round me son
I gotta make it to heaven, for going through hell
Gotta make it to heaven, gotta make it to heaven

Gotta make it to heaven I hope I make it to heaven
When I come through the hood, I don't stop the rapping niggaz
Get close enough to smack, get it clapping nigga
Pac tried to front so I waved the chrome on his ass
Point blank range I span put a bone on his ass
Two weeks later niggas came through with Maks to lay me down
Then sprayed I played dead and got the fuck off the ground
Out the blue I get a phone call, 50 what up?
You send a bitch at me I send the bitch back cut up
I don't play that pussy shit, I done told you boy
Front on me, you gon meet one of my soldiers boy
Cause Entwain shot up his mamma crib an now he in Jail
Trippin on Fliks an bogger trail, pussy in black tail
Pack mamma moved, but she don't talk to him no more
The shells from twains 4-4, blew the hinge off her do'
Without that Tec every month how she gon pay for the crib
Man social service finis' come and take them kids
I gotta make it to heaven, for going through hell
Gotta make it to heaven, gotta make it to heaven
I gotta make it to heaven, for going through hell
Gotta make it to heaven I hope I make it to heaven
I gotta make it to heaven, for going through hell
Gotta make it to heaven, gotta make it to heaven
I gotta make it to heaven, for going through hell
Gotta make it to heaven I hope I make it to heaven
Lord, grant me the serenity to accept the things I can not change, the courage
To change the things I can, but wisdom to know the difference
But A, Ade did a make you say that I say that
That's the credit put in your head when you a case act
Man I might talk to you while we up in the Penz
But when we come home, that don't mean we goin' fuck an be friends
Shells smash ya head close enough to hear 'em whistling
Thank god they missed you, an go grab ya pistol
In the hood niggas running round acting crazy
Buying little air Jordan's for maybe babies
See it might be his, an it might be yours
Cause them broads in the projects is straight up whores
Man it don't take much for you to get in them draws
You ain't can have 'em on they back or on all fours
You got to tell me, you feeling this shit
Because I hear what I'm saying I know I'm killing this shit
I gotta make it to heaven, for going through hell
Gotta make it to heaven, gotta make it to heaven
I gotta make it to heaven, for going through hell

I gotta make it to heaven, for going through hell
Gotta make it to heaven I hope I make it to heaven

Yea
Let's take'em back
Uh huh
Coming up I was confused
My mama kissing a girl
Confusion occurs
Coming up in a cold world
Daddy aint around
Probably out committing felonies
My favorite rapper used to sing
Check, check out my melody
I wanna live good so shit I sell dope
For a four-finger ring
One of them gold ropes
Nana told me if I passed I get a sheep skin coat
If I could move a few packs
I get the hat
Now that'll be dope
Tossed and turn in my sleep that night
Woke up the next morning
Niggaz done stole my bike
Different day, same shit
Ain't nothing good in the hood
I run away from this bitch
And never come back if I could


Hate it or love it the under dog's on top
And I'm gon shine homie until my heart stop

Go'head'n envy me
I'm rap's MVP
And I ain't going no where
So you can get to know me

Hate it or love it the under dog's on top
And I'm gon shine homie until my heart stop

Go'head'n envy me
I'm rap's MVP
And I ain't going no where
So you can get to know me
G-G-G-G-G-G-G-Unit

On the grill of ma low rider
Guns on both sides
Right above the gold wires I four-five'em
Kill a nigga on ma song
And really do it
That's the true meaning of a ghostwriter
Ten g'z will take your daughter outta air forces
Believe you me homie, I know all about losses
I'm from Compton, where the wrong colors, be cautious
One phone call, have your body dumped in Marcy
I stay strapped like car seats
Been banging since ma lil' nigga, rob, got killed for his Barkley's
That's ten years
I told Pooh in '95
I'll kill you if you try me for my air-max 95's
Told Banks when I met'em I'm a ride
And if I gotta die, rather homicide
I ain't had 50 cent when ma grand-mama died
Now I'm going back to Cali with ma jacob on
See how time fly?


Hate it or love it the under dog's on top
And I'm gon shine homie until my heart stop

Go'head'n envy me
I'm rap's MVP
And I ain't going no where
So you can get to know me

Hate it or love it the under dog's on top
And I'm gon shine homie until my heart stop

Go'head'n envy me
I'm rap's MVP
And I ain't going no where
So you can get to know me

From the beginning to the end
Losers lose, winners win
This is real we aint gotta pretend
The cold world that we in
It's full of pressure and pain
Enough of me nigga now listen to Game

Used to see 5-0 throw the crack by the bench
Now I'm fucking with 5-0, it's all starting to make sense
My Ma's happy, she aint gotta pay the rent
And she got a red bow on that brand new Benz
Waiting on Sha Money to land sitting in the range
Thinking how they spend 30 million dollars on airplanes
When there's kids starving
Pac is gone, and Brenda still throwing babies in the garbage
I wanna know what's going on like I hear Marvin
No school books
They use their wood to build coffins
Whenever I'm in a booth
And I get exhausted
I think what if Marie Baker got that abortion
I love you Ma


Hate it or love it the under dog's on top
And I'm gon shine homie until my heart stop

Go'head'n envy me
I'm rap's MVP
And I ain't going no where
So you can get to know me
I need you to pray for me and
I need you to care for me and
I need you to want me to win
I need to know where I'm heading cause I know where I've been
The flow is bone crushing, it's nothing, I come up with something
Come through your strip fronting, stunting
It's something you want, 745 chrome spinners
Haters hate that I'm winning
Man, I've been hot from the beginning
Motherfuckers envy the kid, control your jealousy
Cause I can't control my temper, I'm finna catch a felony
Pistol in hand, homie, I'm down to get it popping
Once I squeeze the first shot you know I ain't stopping
'Till my clip is empty, I'm simply
Not that nigga you should try your luck with or fuck with
Hollow-tip shells struck you with your bones broken, guns smoking, still locing
What nigga, lay your ass down, paramedics get you up feeling
Right now I'm on the edge so don't push me
I aim straight for your head so don't push me
Fill your ass up with lead,so don't push me
I got something for your ass, keep thinking I'm pussy
Right now I'm on the edge so don't push me
I aim straight for your head so don't push me
Fill your ass up with lead,so don't push me
I got something for your ass, keep thinking I'm pussy
I done lost my bigger nigga and I didn't cry
To young to understand the consequences of a man
Living a lie, I gotta get that money
I'll be damned if I'm bummy
Gotta watch my back around these niggas cause they funny
20 years of watching my mama's tears got my heated, heavily weeded
Smoking that bong cause I need it
These niggas don't want me balling, they want me buried
Bogged in the dirt from shots flurried
Laying with bugs under my shirt
I got plans to hop up in that Hummer
Cause I'm a stunner, I sit back and wonder
When them angels gonna call my number under
My chest is a heart of a lion
I ain't lying, bounty hunters got me flying
With my iron, high as a giant
I'm running from nothing, my stomach is touching what I'm clutching
To give you more than a concussion, end of discussion
My blood is colder so I'm bolder
Hennessy and soda, hood on my shoulder
Look in the mirror, I see a soldier
Right now I'm on the edge so don't push me
I aim straight for your head so don't push me
Fill your ass up with lead,so don't push me
I got something for your ass, keep thinking I'm pussy
Right now I'm on the edge so don't push me
I aim straight for your head so don't push me
Fill your ass up with lead,so don't push me
I got something for your ass, keep thinking I'm pussy
These are my ideas, this is my sweat and tears
This is shit that I saw with my eyeballs, my ears
This is me, who's gotta be what you see on TV
What you hear on CD, what appears easy
Man these teenie boppers see me on these magazine covers
In these beanies and these rags living fantasies
Fronting like it's all fun and games 'til the shoot 'em up bang
And you see your brains hang and you see we ain't playing
Ain't saying we ain't laying down at night and ain't praying
I bullied my way in this game, man, I'm done playing
Man, I'm done saying that I'm done playing
I'mma start laying into these motherfucking cocksuckers
There's no way I'm back down like a god damn coward
I can't, how would I look as a man bowing to his knees?
Like the mad cow disease, let somebody lash out at me
And not lash back out at 'em, please
Oh, whoa, yo, ho, hold up, oh no, not me, not Marshall
You wanna see Marshall? I'll show you Marshall
I try to show you art, but you just pick it apart
So I see I have to start, showing you fucking old farts
A whole other side I wanted to not show you
So you know you're not dealing with some fucking marshmallow
Little soft yellow, punk pussy, whose heart's Jello cause
Right now I'm on the edge so don't push me
I aim straight for your head so don't push me
Fill your ass up with lead,so don't push me
I got something for your ass, keep thinking I'm pussy
Right now I'm on the edge so don't push me
I aim straight for your head so don't push me
Fill your ass up with lead,so don't push me
I got something for your ass, keep thinking I'm pussy
Shady Aftermath, nigga, G-Unit
Rap juggernauts of this shit, we taking over
If there's beef cock it and dump it
The drama really means nothing to me
I'll ride by and blow ya brains out
There's no time to cock it, no way you can stop it
When niggas run up on you with them thangs out
I do what I gotta do, I don't care I if get caught
The DA can play this motherfucking tape in court
I'll kill you
I ain't playing, hear what I'm saying, homie, I ain't playing
Catch you slipping I'mma kill you
I ain't playing, hear what I'm saying, homie I ain't playing
Keep thinking I'm candy 'till ya fucking skull get popped
And ya brain jump out the top like Jack-in-the-box
In the hood summer time is the killing season
It's hot out this bitch that's a good enough reason
I've seen gangstas get religious when they start bleeding
Saying "Lord, Jesus help me" cause they ass leaking
When they window roll down and that A.K. come out
You can squeeze ya little handgun until you run out
And you can run for ya backup
But them machine gun shells gone tear ya back up
God's on ya side? Shit, I'm aight with that
Cause we gon' reload them clips and come right back
It's a fact, homie, you go against me ya fucked
I get the drop, if you can duck ya luckier then Lady Luck
Look, nigga, don't think you safe cause you moved out the hood
Cause ya mama still around, dawg, and that ain't good
If you was smart you'd be shook of me
Cause I'd get tired of looking for ya, spray ya mama crib
And let ya ass look for me
If there's beef cock it and dump it
The drama really means nothing to me
I'll ride by and blow ya brains out
There's no time to cock it, no way you can stop it
When niggas run up on you with them thangs out
I do what I gotta do, I don't care I if get caught
The DA can play this motherfucking tape in court
I'll kill you
I ain't playing, hear what I'm saying, homie, I ain't playing
Catch you slipping I'mma kill you
I ain't playing, hear what I'm saying, homie I ain't playing
My heart bleeds for you, nigga, I can't wait to get to you
Behind that twinkle in ya eyes I can see the bitch in you
Nigga, you know the streets talk
So they'll be no white flags and no peace talks
I got my back against the wind, I'm down to ride 'till the sun burn out
If I die today I'm happy how my life turned out
See the shootouts that I've been in I'm by myself
Locked up I was in a box by myself
I done made myself a millionaire by myself
Now shit changed, motherfucker, I can hire some help
I done heard about the 50 grand you put in the hood
But ya shooter fin'nin to get shot, it won't do him no good
With a pistol I define the definition of pain
If you survive ya bones'll still fucking hurt when it rain
Oh, you a pro at playing battleship? Well, this ain't the same
Little homie this is a whole different type of war game
See the losers end up in shackles and motherfucking chains
Or laid out in the streets leaking out they brains
If there's beef cock it and dump it
The drama really means nothing to me
I'll ride by and blow ya brains out
There's no time to cock it, no way you can stop it
When niggas run up on you with them thangs out
I do what I gotta do, I don't care I if get caught
The DA can play this motherfucking tape in court
I'll kill you
I ain't playing, hear what I'm saying, homie, I ain't playing
Catch you slipping I'mma kill you
I ain't playing, hear what I'm saying, homie I ain't playing
After the fist fights it's gunfire, boy, you get the best of me
If you don't wanna get shot I suggest you don't go testing me
All the wrong I've done the Lord still keep on blessing me
Fin'nin to run rap cause Dr. Dre got the recipe
Go, go, go, go go, go, go, shawty
It's your birthday
We gon' party like it's yo birthday
We gon' sip Bacardi like it's your birthday
And you know we don't give a fuck
It's not your birthday!
You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub
Look mami I got the X if you into taking drugs

So come give me a hug if you into to getting rubbed
You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub
Look mami I got the X if you into taking drugs
I'm into having sex, I ain't into making love
So come give me a hug if you into to getting rubbed
When I pull out up front, you see the Benz on dubs
When I roll twenty deep, it's twenty knives in the club
Niggas heard I fuck with Dre, now they want to show me love
When you sell like Eminem, and the hoes they want to fuck
But homie ain't nothing change hold down, G's up
I see Xzibit in the Cutt that nigga roll that weed up
If you watch how I move you'll mistake me for a player or pimp
Been hit wit a few shells but I don't walk wit a limp
In the hood then the ladies saying "50 you hot"
They like me, I want them to love me like they love 'Pac
But holla in New York them niggas'll tell ya I'm loco
And the plan is to put the rap game in a choke hold
I'm feelin' focused man, my money on my mind
I got a mill out the deal and I'm still on the grind
Now shawty said she feeling my style, she feeling my flow
Her girlfriend want to get bi and they ready to go
You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub
Look mami I got the X if you into taking drugs
I'm into having sex, I ain't into making love
So come give me a hug if you into to getting rubbed
You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub
Look mami I got the X if you into taking drugs
I'm into having sex, I ain't into making love
So come give me a hug if you into to getting rubbed
My flow, my show brought me the dough
That bought me all my fancy things
My crib, my cars, my pools, my jewels
Look, nigga, I came up and I ain't changed
And you should love it, way more then you hate it
Nigga you mad? I thought that you'd be happy I made it
I'm that cat by the bar toasting to the good life
You that fagot ass nigga trying to pull me back right?
When my junk get to pumping in the club it's on
I wink my eye at ya bitch, if she smiles she gone
If the roof on fire, let the motherfucker burn
If you talking bout money homie, I ain't concerned
I'm a tell you what Banks told me cause go 'head switch the style up
If the niggas hate then let 'em hate
Watch the money pile up
Or we go upside there wit a bottle of bub
You know where we fucking be
You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub
Look mami I got the X if you into taking drugs
I'm into having sex, I ain't into making love
So come give me a hug if you into to getting rubbed
You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub
Look mami I got the X if you into taking drugs
I'm into having sex, I ain't into making love
So come give me a hug if you into to getting rubbed
Don't try to act like you ain't know where we been either, nigga
In the club all the time, nigga, so it's a problem pop off, nigga, G-Unit!

You don't see me in the hood, it's cause I'm doing this man
Niggas, I'm still grinding (yeah), I still hearing those sirens
I'm still getting chased by those lights
Only the light's lime, and my mic's on
And my time is none, because I'm writing more
I don't hear to meet a soul in this business
I'm here to eat, speak, until these ho's feel this
I ain't gonna let you derail me, man
I got Young Kobe homey, you gotta let go of Obie
Cause Obie be back, (going nowhere, man) we got them craps going on
And that yak going on, soon as a nigga touch down, back from town
It's forever, put that on the cheddar, man
But in the meantime, it's Jimmy Iovine time
Chase cheese, rhyme 'til my voice give out
This is it my niggas, this what we boast about
Now I'm here, so shut your motherfucking mouth, and show me love, bitch

I just want to love, for the rest of my life (I don't love you, bitch)
I want to hold you in the morn, hold you thorough the night
(Right we want to love alcohol, we want to love guns, we want to love money
we don't love no bitches, though)
I just want to love, for the rest of my life
I want to hold you in the morn, hold you in the night

There's a certain mystique when I speak, that you notice
Cause it's sort of unique 'cause you know it's me
My poetry's deep, and I'm still-matic, the way I flow to this beat
You can't sit still, it's like trying to smoke crack and go to sleep
I'm strapped, it's known any minute I could snap
I'm the equivalent of what would happen if Bush rapped
I bully these rappers so bad lyrically
It ain't even funny, I ain't even hungry, it ain't even money
You can't pay me enough for you to play me
It's cockamamie you just ain't zany enough to rock with Shady
My noodle is cock-a-doodle, my clock's coo-coo
I got screws loose, yea the whole kit and caboodle, I'm just brutal
It's no rumor, I'm numero uno, assume it, there's no more humor in it, you know
I'm rolling with a swollen bowling ball in my bag
You need a fag and tear a new hole in my ass, you better love me, bitch


My buzz is crazy in the hood, they holla my name
If it ain't about the flow, it's 'bout the stones and the chain
If I was you, I'd love men too, I roll like a boss
Nine eleven Porsche same color as cranberry sauce
I ain't gon' front, I thought R. Kelly was the shit
Let me find out he fucking 'round with Bow Wow bitch
Niggas eating popcorn, right, rewinding the tape
Now shorty mama in the precinct hollering rape
I'm convinced, man, something really wrong with these ho's
I thought Lil' Kim was hot, 'til she start fucking with her nose
I used to listen to Lauryn Hill, and tap my feet
Then the bitch put out a CD and didn't have no beats
That nigga D'Angelo, he determined not to fail
That nigga went butt-ass, for his record to sell
My back shot to help Ashanti hit them high notes
And Big Ben taught Charlie B 'More to deep throat (yea)


I love the burners, the money, the bunnies, I just want to hold you, ha ha
I just want to love you, yea
Man we gotta go get something to eat man
I'm hungry as a motherfucker
Hey yo man, damn what's taking homie so long son?
50, calm down, here he come
What the fuck!?
Son, pull up! pull up!
Many men, wish death upon me
Blood in my eye dog and I can't see
I'm trying to be what I'm destined to be
And niggas trying to take my life away
I put a hole in nigga for fucking with me
My back on the wall, now you gon' see
Better watch how you talk, when you talk about me
'Cause I'll come and take your life away
Many men, many, many, many, many men
Wish death 'pon me
Lord I don't cry no more
Don't look to the sky no more
Have mercy on me
Now these pussy niggas putting money on my head
Go on and get your refund motherfucker, I ain't dead
I'm the diamond in the dirt, that ain't been found
I'm the underground king and I ain't been crowned
When I rhyme, something special happen every time
I'm the greatest, something like Ali in his prime
I walk the block with the bundles
I've been knocked on the humble
Swing the ox when I rumble
Show your ass what my gun do
Got a temper nigga, go 'head, lose your head
Turn your back on me, get clapped and lose your legs
I walk around gun on waist, chip on my shoulder
Till I bust a clip in your face, pussy, this beef ain't over
Many men, many, many, many, many men
Wish death 'pon me
Lord I don't cry no more
Don't look to the sky no more
Have mercy on me
Have mercy on my soul
Somewhere my heart turned cold
Have mercy on many men
Many, many, many, many men
Wish death upon me
Sunny days wouldn't be special, if it wasn't for rain
Joy wouldn't feel so good, if it wasn't for pain
Death gotta be easy, 'cause life is hard
It'll leave you physically, mentally, and emotionally scarred
This if for my niggas on the block, twisting trees and cigars
For the niggas on lock, doing life behind bars
I don't see only god can judge me, 'cause I see things clear
Quick these crackers will give my black ass a hundred years
I'm like Paulie in Goodfellas, you can call me the Don
Like Malcolm by any means, with my gun in my palm
Slim switched sides on me, let niggas ride on me
I thought we was cool, why you want me to die homie?
Many men, many, many, many, many men
Wish death 'pon me
Lord I don't cry no more
Don't look to the sky no more
Have mercy on me
Have mercy on my soul
Somewhere my heart turned cold
Have mercy on many men
Many, many, many, many men
Wish death upon me
Every night I talk to god, but he don't say nothing back
I know he protecting me, but I still stay with my gat
In my nightmares, niggas keep pulling techs on me
Psych says some bitch dumb, put a hex on me
The feds didn't know much, when Pac got shot
I got a kite from the pens that told me, Tuck got knocked
I ain't gonna spell it out for you motherfuckers all the time
Are you illiterate nigga? You can't read between the lines
In the bible it says, what goes around, comes around
Almost shot me, three weeks later he got shot down
Now it's clear that I'm here, for a real reason
'Cause he got hit like I got hit, but he ain't fucking breathing
Many men, many, many, many, many men
Wish death 'pon me
Lord I don't cry no more
Don't look to the sky no more
Have mercy on me
Have mercy on my soul
Somewhere my heart turned cold
Have mercy on many men
Many, many, many, many men
Wish death upon me
Hey Em, you know you my favorite white boy right?
I owe you for this one
I've been patiently waiting for a track to explode on
You can stun if you want and your ass will get rolled on
It feels like my flows been hot for so long
If you thinking I'm fucking fall off your so wrong
Innocent in my head, like a baby born dead
Destination heaven, sit and politic with passengers from nine eleven
The lords blessings leave me lyrically inclined
Shit I ain't even gotta try to shine
God's the seamstress that tailor fitted my pain
I got scriptures in my brain I could spit at your dame
Straight out the good book, look, niggas is shook
50 fears no man, warrior swing swords like Conan
Picture me pen in hand write lines knowing the source'll quote it
When I die, they'll read this and say a genius wrote it
I grew up without my pops should that make me bitter?
I caught cases I copped out does that make me a quitter?
In this white man's world I'm similar to a squirrel
Lookin for a slut with a nice butt to get a nut
If I get shot today my phone will stop ringing again
These industry niggaz ain't friends, they know how to pretend
Patiently waiting to make it through all the hating
Debating whether or not you could even weather the storm.
Just lay on the table they operating to save you
Its like an angel came to you sent from the heavens above
They think they're crazy but they ain't crazy lets face it, shit basically
They just playing sick, they ain't shit They ain't saying shit, spray 'em Fifty
A to the K, get in the way I'll bring Dre and them wit me
And turn this day into fucking mayhem you staying with me?
Don't let me lose you, I'm not trying to confuse you
When I let loose with this Uzi and just shoot through your Isuzu
You get the message am I getting through to you?
You know whats coming you motherfuckers don't even know do you?
Take some Big and some Pac and you mix them up in a pot
Sprinkle a little Big L on top, and what the fuck do you got?
You got the realest and illest killers tied up in a knot
The Juggernauts of this rap shit like it or not
Its like a fight to the top just to see who died for the spot
You put your life in this, nothing like surviving the shot
Y'all know what time it is as soon as Fifty signs on this dot
Shit what you know about death threats, 'cause I get a lot
Shady Records was eighty seconds away from the towers
Some cowards fucked with the wrong building they meant to hit ours
Better evacuate all children - nuclear shower
There's nothing spookier, you're now about to witness the power of fuckin Fifty
I've been patiently waiting for a track to explode on
You can stun if you want and your ass will get rolled on
It feels like my flows been hot for so long
If you thinking I'm fucking fall off your so wrong
I've been patiently waiting for a track to explode on
You can stun if you want and your ass will get rolled on
It feels like my flows been hot for so long
If you thinking I'm fucking fall off your so wrong
The guns spark when the shots go off
Its fifty, they say its Fifty
See a nigga laid out with his fucking top blown off
Its fifty, man that wasn't Fifty, they don't holla my name
You shouldn't throw stones if you live in a glass house
And if you got a glass jaw, you should watch your mouth
Cause I'll break your face, have your ass running
Mumbling to the Jake, you going against me dog you making a mistake
Ill split you have you looking like the Michael Jackson's jackets with all them zippers
I'm the boss on this boat, you can call me skipper
The way I turn the money over you should call me flipper
Your bitch, a regular bitch, you calling her wifey
I fucked her, I feed her fast food, you keeping her icy
I'm down to sell records but not my soul
Snoop said this in 94' "We don't love them hoes"
I got pennies for my thoughts, now I'm rich
See the twenty's spinning looking mean on the six
Niggas wearing flags, 'cause the colors match they clothes
They get caught in the wrong hood and get filled up with holes (motherfucker).
I've been patiently waiting for a track to explode on
You can stun if you want and your ass will get rolled on
It feels like my flows been hot for so long
If you thinking I'm fucking fall off your so wrong
I've been patiently waiting for a track to explode on
You can stun if you want and your ass will get rolled on
It feels like my flows been hot for so long
If you thinking I'm fucking fall off your so wrong
Its fifty

You call the cops and i get knocked, I swear to the death of me
The drama's gonna never end, never end
Keep thinkin' I'm playin'
It's hard, yeah, it's hard, this that New York shit
That black glove, wood grip, outline 'em and chalk shit
I don't wanna talk, say a prayer for my enemies
Droptop, ten shots, I'll make your ass a memory
Time to ride, homicide, I'm down with it
I'll wave that chopper, hit your whip and shake the ground with it
Fuck with N dot Bonepart, get your ass blown apart
Hip hop's Napoleon, you know war, you know me then
I'll hunt you like a great dane
Hit you, hit you like a freight train
Run off with your fake chains
I'll give you mothafuckas somethin' to believe in
Knife work your lungs, I'll make it hard to breathe in
Little shit could be a big enough reason
You're dancin' with the wolves, fool, better feed them
I feel for you, you ain't ready for the outcome
Nigga I'll get at you all week with the same gun
I get that gun, you know that blow and baking soda be the recipe
For sure I make that .40 Cali' blow, you get the best of me
The drama's gonna never end, never end
Keep thinkin' I'm playin'
I know for sure I'll split your mothafuckin' head, you get to testin' me
You call the cops and i get knocked, I swear to the death of me
The drama's gonna never end, never end
Keep thinkin' I'm playin'
Me I punch every nigga first I had a fight with
Maybe it's genetics, mama made me like this
Cocaine baby, problem child, half crazy
Children of the Corn, I've been warned so long
Big strap for robberies with my little 380
I'll make your little lady miscarry a baby
You leave the scene unseen when I get to trippin'
Pistol whip your head hard enough to blur your vision
What up, comrade, salute, I pull rank, I got bank
Just fucked up work, askin' if we'll use shanks
Every clique I'm in my clique, nigga, I run shit
I put in my own work, run, get who you gon' get
This is how it feels when you squeeze a Smith & Wesson
When talk is not an option, it's a form of expression
You got to go to work on a nigga
The red shit comin' through the shirt on a nigga
My gift to a gravedigger
My everything
I only imagine you in every way
I only think of you, all night and all day
I only want you when I'm awake and when I'm sleep
You don't mean a thing cause you mean everything to me, oh ho

Fuck it, I mean we gotta kill what we eat, right?
It's not a problem, it's really not a problem. Southside
Okay, the dope addin' up, the coke addin' up
The smoke addin' up, my pockets are fattened up
I got bitches in my bedroom, nerds on computers
Diamonds 'round my neck, straps for my shooters
I made it, look ma', I made it
I grind so hard to get here I can't be faded
I got lawyers on the line, five different kinds
Five different crimes, same .45
Got a plan to turn to premise, see, a nigga ain't lyin'
'Cause they ain't gon' say I did it and I ain't gon' say I did it
And I might go back and forth to court, but I bet I get acquitted
Can you dig it? Nigga, can you dig it?
Shit changed, a nigga ain't broke
I had a safe size as a shoe box, it felt like a vault
Now I got real money, that "fuck how you feel" money
That "nigga, you look at me wrong, get killed" money
You gon' be part of my body bag ritual
Hop out, hammer out to get at you
You gon' be part of my body bag ritual
.45 lettin' off some shit at you
You gon' be put in a body bag, bag
You won't get a chance to fire back
I peep my swag in the mirror, I think I got a crush on me
I don't want no wack bitches touchin' me
Tailor-made threads, satin sheets on my bed
Get a bitch sea-sick, waves all on my head
Diamonds in my ear, Baccarat chandelier
Gabbana underwear, I'm so fly it ain't fair
Every day a different dime piece
Rose Gold, a different time piece
Hublot, AP or Rollie
Your bitch and your jeweler know me, homie
I'm bulletproof, go 'head, take a shot at me
You be a dead nigga like the last one that got at me
My shirt level three, so I ain't got a vest on
My heart like ice, my chest like teflon
I'm a nightmare right here, just me and my knife, nigga
Don't let me find out you ain't 'bout that life, nigga
It's doomsday, I mean goon day
I give the orders, like, "air out the room, Dre"
You gon' be part of my body bag ritual
Hop out, hammer out to get at you
You gon' be part of my body bag ritual
.45 lettin' off some shit at you
You gon' be put in a body bag, bag
You won't get a chance to fire back
The mileage had a shorty ass trippin', strippin' in my kitchen
Push my thumb in her ass while I was strokin' her kitten
I be in my own zone, still clutchin' the chrome
Talk state of the art, [?]
My passport need pages, I'm fuckin' round' out in London
Jetlag from jets [?] baguettes
Trippin' in my charm, look bitch, I'm a don
So shit go how I say it go, fuck if I'm right or wrong
My paper long, bomb Kush in the bong
It feels like I'm dreamin' 'cause a nigga on
I'm so far from a hammy down, I'm out in Miami now
My bitch no speak no ingles, she fresh off the boat
She give me neck, what you expect? I got connects for the dope
I'm no joke, blow 30k on the coke, stuff ten in the coat
Nigga, front, I'll have a hand full of dreadlocks
Bitch, I hit your ass with a head-shot
You gon' be part of my body bag ritual
Hop out, hammer out to get at you
You gon' be part of my body bag ritual
.45 lettin' off some shit at you
You gon' be put in a body bag, bag
You won't get a chance to fire back

Banana clip, banana split, I be on some gangsta shit
Dump 30 here, dump 30 there, I make it hot up out this bitch
My diamonds bigger, grimy niggas, city slicker, pull the trigger
Line a nigga, it's a stick up, money pick up, dust kick up
Tires screeching when I'm reaching, 50 preach in church, bitch
This is pimping, fuck around and end up in the worst shit
Hollow tip, .40 mag, bloody rags, toe tag
Body bag, killer swag, blood all on my Gucci shit
Now I'm mad in the Jag, same day, this is bad
Fucking fag, look at your ass, why you make me do this shit?
I'm built for this, so I was told
Since mama gone I've been on my own
I'm for real about it, man, fuck how you feel about it
Nigga, we in the streets, that's why we holdin' heat
I get that gun, you know that blow and baking soda be the recipe
For sure I make that .40 Cali' blow, you get the best of me
The drama's gonna never end, never end
Keep thinkin' I'm playin'
I know for sure I'll split your mothafuckin' head, you get to testin' me
You call the cops and i get knocked, I swear to the death of me
The drama's gonna never end, never end
Keep thinkin' I'm playin'
It's hard, yeah, it's hard, this that New York shit
That black glove, wood grip, outline 'em and chalk shit
I don't wanna talk, say a prayer for my enemies
Droptop, ten shots, I'll make your ass a memory
Time to ride, homicide, I'm down with it
I'll wave that chopper, hit your whip and shake the ground with it
Fuck with N dot Bonepart, get your ass blown apart
Hip hop's Napoleon, you know war, you know me then
I'll hunt you like a great dane
Hit you, hit you like a freight train
Run off with your fake chains
I'll give you mothafuckas somethin' to believe in
Knife work your lungs, I'll make it hard to breathe in
Little shit could be a big enough reason
You're dancin' with the wolves, fool, better feed them
I feel for you, you ain't ready for the outcome
Nigga I'll get at you all week with the same gun
I get that gun, you know that blow and baking soda be the recipe
For sure I make that .40 Cali' blow, you get the best of me
The drama's gonna never end, never end
Keep thinkin' I'm playin'
I know for sure I'll split your mothafuckin' head, you get to testin' me
You call the cops and i get knocked, I swear to the death of me
The drama's gonna never end, never end
Keep thinkin' I'm playin'
Me I punch every nigga first I had a fight with
Maybe it's genetics, mama made me like this
Cocaine baby, problem child, half crazy
Children of the Corn, I've been warned so long
Big strap for robberies with my little 380
I'll make your little lady miscarry a baby
You leave the scene unseen when I get to trippin'
Pistol whip your head hard enough to blur your vision
What up, comrade, salute, I pull rank, I got bank
Just fucked up work, askin' if we'll use shanks
Every clique I'm in my clique, nigga, I run shit
I put in my own work, run, get who you gon' get
This is how it feels when you squeeze a Smith & Wesson
When talk is not an option, it's a form of expression
You got to go to work on a nigga
The red shit comin' through the shirt on a nigga
My gift to a gravedigger
I came in the world cryin' and fussin'
Nigga, we ain't have nothin'
Every ghetto I know the same
We try to make a little change
Preacher man come around talkin'
I don't wanna hear it, keep walkin'
I'mma put the powder in the pot
Whip it 'till I'm pullin' off a lot
Imagine when I pull it off the lot
New shit come without a top
Once I'm on I ain't never gon' stop
Bitch, I'm on, I ain't never gon' stop
I'm the man
Aye, came in the game gettin' money
Flippin' checks, whip it, gettin' money
Niggas get to playin' with the money
Clique bang for the money
Shit changed over money
They love to see a nigga on the bottom
Catch it coming, gotta keep it on the low
A nigga plug bless a nigga with a whole
Wanna break the bitch down into 36 O's
Looky here, bitch, I'm A-okay

Ridin' around in that foreign, all your stories sound distorted
Got so many Cuban links with me, my chain could get deported
At the bar takin' shots, seek her out, you need reloader
If you even took a bitch from me, I come back to repo her
Dirty Sprite, I'll repour it, smellin' like a car dealership
And I don't think it's gon' work out
So, bitch, you need a membership
She said she want a stunner

For real, huh, and I'm still ridin' one hand on the wheel

Fifty, fifty
Ferrari, Ferrari
Shooter, shooter
I was innocent then, I ain't do no wrong
She said, "you mommy little man," I said, "yep, uh huh"
She was everything to me, when she came, I just lit up
Sunday morning I was so sharp, all did up
It was welfare hustlin', they killed her for that
The first shot, bullet wound in my back
I'm fucked up, look at my sneakers, I'm fucked up
Now I'm on my own, mommy gone
Sam said, "you a young boy, why your clothes look so old?
You don't need fish, little nigga, you need a pole
You don't need no new kicks, you need an O"
Chop that, bag it, get right back at it
That touched me, it hit me in my heart
I'm a hustler, homie, you was giving me my start
I am what I am, Sabrina's only baby
Practicing in the mirror, pulling out my .380
Oh man, I fucked up nana gonna kill me
Whenever shit can go wrong it always will, see
Seven grams of cocaine, three grams of dope
Saint Mary medallion hanging from my rope
Try to punk me and my gun smoke
Look, I'm outta control, my gun go
Off like it's legal, call the cops, you need to
Give 'em my description, I ain't bullshittin'
My high school sweetheart love didn't last long
Niggas start flashing that bread and she was gone
That hurt me like the bullet in my calf then
My next girl was a pain in the ass
I got two shots left, in case niggas try to get me
That's nine shots, we just call it fifty
Mama said the Lord gon' bless us
Mama said, mama said
Mama said the Lord gon' bless us
Then in came the landlord, beef, and the stresses
Mama said the Lord gon' bless us
Mama said, mama said
Mama said the Lord gon' bless us
The dope bought the shit the food stamps couldn't get us
Mama said the Lord gon' bless us
That's what mama said, that's what mama said
Fifty, fifty

Rather be buried than be worried, living held down

So what you sayin', boy? You a shooter, boy?
Nigga, we don't care who you shot
Nigga, quit talkin' money 'round rich niggas
Nigga, we don't care what you got

Pull up in an Aston, pull up in a hooptie

Flexing like "Bitch if you knew better"
You fuck with a real nigga and you do better

Shawty ass fat like she a stripper
That wiggle when she walk make you wanna tip her
Bartenders coming, yeah, they move quicker
Twenty, thirty bottles to the rich niggas

Right before I came into this bitch high
Needed cigarettes, I made a pit stop
Spend my life tryna be a good guy
Still people want to see me get got
Nothing like it ever was before
Hair falling out, I'm twenty years old
Got a lot of stress, that you don't know
Still kick it like paint and this shit gold

Pull up in this bitch and I'm flexing
Jumping out the motherfucking Benz, yeah
All these damn diamonds on my necklace
Catching frostbite when I exit
So goddamn cold, see your breath, yeah
Hundred cigarettes then I exhale
Thousand for these fuckin' Margielas

Hundred thousand chains on my chest, yeah
Ice on my rings, ice and you see me shining
Two hundred K in jewels this year, you can't tell me nothing
And I'm gone, I ain't never sober
Me and Fifty got shooters if you tryna fuck me over


I ain't gonna let the people frisk me if I'm dirty, homie
A nigga never touch me, I got that dirty on me
Y'all tryna fuck me over, y'all always tryna fuck me over

Banks wrote letters so good that I buy
I'm a hoodboss, I'am not shy
I start this music in a role draft
Not with lyrics designed, but with gibberish
Gifts and kisses on the neck of my baby
A super sonic jet is for sale! You pay me?
Oprah sings 'Candy Shop' in the shower
She wears those same clothes
We sang in the range of ESPN as before
The option to switch to the HBO
And is not that we are there, 50 and Y-A-Y-O
Ferrari, Aston, Lambo, I like the black BMW
The price of platinum is in sky
The shine of my Rolex overshadow his shine
I think that money doesn't go away
Jaguar XF by burning all the way
You know, my inbox is full of air
Smile by smile, I love your hair
Lexus sedan nigga, 2008 was a year as good
My page is billing throughout the hood

N**** things, change, dem stay the same
Now watch me come up, I hustle, I hustle even harder
I put that work in to win, no problem
N**** things, change, dem stay the same
Now watch me come up, I hustle, I hustle even harder
I put that work in to win, no problem
All money ain't good money, this I know
But I still love hood money, I gets my dough
And as a youngster, a n**** went to so much church
And still turned out f***ed up, I did so much dirt
Chose to bang the neighborhood, I put in so much work
Did a whole lot of time, caused mom so much hurt
On every thang that boy wasn't gunned on purpose
Who knew that all my darkness was really gon' surface
I was stuck on that bulls***, just runnin' the streets
Without some type of beef the week wasn't complete
It's like a n**** feel better after dumpin' his heat
On feet, just to see that body slumped in the seat
Was like a whole nother rush to me, bustin' was sweet
Now I'm smarter, I'm all about somethin' to eat
I'm on the road, spend 30 days a month' in a suite
But I'm still gon' hustle and cheat, let's go
N**** things, change, dem stay the same
Now watch me come up, I hustle, I hustle even harder
I put that work in to win, no problem
N**** things, change, dem stay the same
Now watch me come up, I hustle, I hustle even harder
I put that work in to win, no problem
Yeah, now walkin' down the block without ya weapon
Is a first cla** ticket to a lesson
I thirst cash, kick it to perfection, me and Bang got a connection
That's why I bring the Benz to impress him
 my zone, all alone homes rattle in my bones
'Cause he yappin' off his lips and if I hit him I'll be wrong
'Cause he ain't never gon' be s*** and I done worked so hard
But I will make you a corn on the cob, you'll be performin' for God
Either that or rob you on your boulevard
Bet you never thought for a second, n****z'd pull your card God
I'm on my job, scarred since my n**** gone
HP tatted on me so his memory lives on
Engagin' in drama without your bomber'll
Be funeral arrangements for your momma
I learned that when I was in pajamas watchin' Michael and Madonna
Now I got the appetite of a piranha, n****
N**** things, change, dem stay the same
Now watch me come up, I hustle, I hustle even harder
I put that work in to win, no problem
N**** things, change, dem stay the same
Now watch me come up, I hustle, I hustle even harder
I put that work in to win, no problem
What nobody knows, all the roads you go through
You can't even talk to those that supposedly know you
Some of the levels that these people'll go to for crumbs
Damn, tell me, is this what that dough do?
That's when you find yourself talkin' to Pro Tools
There's not too many that ever walked in the Loc shoes
Or tell the tale that my heart contains
I explain, so many different parts of pain
I'm clean but still some marks remain
From the past when that kush weed sparks the brain
The cash made some people start to change
I feel hate when I pulled up and parked the Range
Your damn right I got rich but my heart the same
And practice makes perfect with the art of aim
You ain't really got the heart to bang
You ain't start to hang 'til you found out I caught the chain
N**** things, change, dem stay the same
Now watch me come up, I hustle, I hustle even harder
I put that work in to win, no problem
N**** things, change, dem stay the same
Now watch me come up, I hustle, I hustle even harder
I put that work in to win, no problem

Yea, uhuh, lets take em dere, yea
Man Sonny a fed joint, he half way out
He ain't home, his ass in a halfway house
Correctional facilities don't correct shit
'Cause the first thing he asked is who gotta get hit
A shoot out in 89 fucked up how he walk
He a grimey ass nigga, you see how he talk
Should shoot the Shepard in the head and da sheep gon? scatter
Let niggas talk cause action is all that matters
I asked about Bones self-esteem, he said he was soft
Said the boys up in Odasville was breakin' him off
Can you picture him in a jar, niggas jokin' him up
Treatin' him like a pin cushion, pokin him up
He came home actin' like he hard as fuck
Must want a first class nigga to see God, uhuh
Stuck his chest out tell a niggas we don't back down
But wait until we find out Sonny?s background
Maybe we crazy, but this is the way we came up
Nigga front, and somethin' gon go down
Nigga stunt, cruise to this bitch if you want
Widout a strap, and you gon getcha ass laid down
Maybe we crazy, but this is the way we came up
Nigga front, and somethin' gon go down
Nigga stunt, cruise to this bitch if you want
Widout a strap, and you gon getcha ass laid down
My nigga LOC?s comin' home soon he up there in four dicks
It's on when he touch that cause he can get enough bricks
When I was young he told me not to run, I pop my gun pa
You can ask gun or la la love then aim hard
I'm interested to hear ?bang? back in the days
They ain't better than my brain, young crime is pay
New Cadillacs and Bonneville's the very next day
I just hope he learn, I ain't have much to say
Lead us squeeze the life out you like a boa constrictor
Fuck a headlock, I'm talking bout extortion nigga
Apply pressure, its hot get the fuck out the kitchen
When niggas pay ya every Friday you ain't got to stick em
At the dice game if ace roll a six its no problem
But if you roll a ace he gon pull out a Robin
Losin' a little or lose lot, when niggas is starving
Man the drama in my hoods goin' down regardless
Maybe we crazy, but this is the way we came up
Nigga front, and somethin' gon go down
Nigga stunt, cruise to this bitch if you want

Maybe we crazy, but this is the way we came up

Caught him spending 545 I no lie ask how

Be must?ve caught his crooks 'coz D flashin' his mugshot

Nigga stunt, cruise to this bitch if you want
Widout a strap, and you gon getcha ass laid down

Yeah.. Ja, you ready? Drop that
Ferrari F 50 style baby (yeah, yeah)
I'ma show 'em how I do it (yeah, yeah)
G-g-g-g-g G-UNIT!
I keep hearin' niggas is happy, the D's come, niggas wit guns
When I'm out on bail, ridin' wit' some new ones
Big got hit in that passenger seat
Pac got hit in that passenger seat
Now I'm ridin' 'round in that passenger seat
Come near the whip, I'm blastin' my heat
It don't take long, for my juvenile delinquent thinkin' to sink in
The consequences mean nothin', those semi auto's is bustin'
Crack sellin', predicate villain, spit big words but I can't spell 'em
Put a shot to your melon, that'll keep you're punk ass from chillin'
Then I got that nine and a fo'-fo', that H2 is never full
Bullet proof windows and doors, gangsta how 'bout yours
Southside tatted on my back
My last gun shipment got the whole hood strapped
Now all I got is two 380's and a nine
Nigga you can knock and tell the cops but you're dyin'

You're thicker than water
Ouch! twizzy wizzy wa
You're thicker than water
Ouch! twizzy wizzy wa
You're thicker than water
Ouch! twizzy wizzy wa
You can be a Blood or a Crip
Nigga, you bitch
Follow Me

I used to chill in the hood, to support the fiends
But now I'm eatin' caviar instead of pork and beans
I'm in the money green 7-45, with 7 shots in the fo' five
y'all niggas want to die?
I got a love affair, wit' violence and guns
So this is for them gangstas, rep' where you from
When I got O'd up, my heart turned colder
That's why the mac react like a king cobra
Now I'm jumpin' out of Rovers, in Gucci loafers
y'all niggas want to stun? I'll bury you cockroaches
Gimme one year, in this industry
I'll buy enough guns to declare war on a small country


Still walk around wit' the hammer boss
Rope and a cross
Hard times'll make a lil' nigga hate Santa Claus
Your mountains is high, holdin' in Diana Ross
I'm like a 2003 banana Porsche
I don't gotta hide sluts, to get your ties cut
They on my dick, 'cause I make groupies set off a fire truck
My team in the cutt, packin' middle things
I got more foreign shooters than the Sacramento Kings
It's 8 class karats in the border
I poke holes in plastic, to avoid a vaginal disorder
I'm a savage on your daughter
She ain't in the college dorm
Then I guess I'm squirtin' on the cabin that you bought her
I'm a heavy weed smoker, so the average is a quarter
Brown colored from shit, he established in the water
You got Banks on your jersey, you part of my fan base
Just 'cause you pour syrup on shit, don't make it pancakes

Yeah, this somethin' special why'know, somethin' epic
Lloyd Banks, you know
'Cause a nigga thuggin' don't mean he don't
Don't wanna see you smile baby
I wanna be the reason you smile
I wanna be the reason you smile
I wanna be the reason you smile
After you wipe away your tears and dry your eyes
I'm gettin' the feelin', you wanna take revenge
From the conversations, we have and the way it ends
You wanna discuss me in front of your lady friends
That's why it's just me and my Mercedes Benz
It all depends, maybe if we make amends
We can start from scratch
Learn to control your temper and remarks in fact
We plan to be platonic with our hearts in tact
So every time we separate, somebody's marchin' back
You're amazing in the sack, eyes slanted like you're Asian
But you're black, God bless whoever gave you alla that
If you seen her from the back, you'd understand why dis feel like that
And ain't a flaw to her toes, the Lord knows
Her pussy good enough to miss award shows
And I ain't gotta say nothin', she just knows
By the way I look at her to take off all her clothes up and down
Whenever I'm not around and you feelin' down
Let the thought of me be

I don't wanna see you frown, like them kids watch a clown
I wanna bring you joy and be

Baby, you know my style, you know how I get down
I provide by any means to be

We done been through ups and downs, had drama for a while
I'm just happy I'm around to be

The main reason I been lookin' at you pitiful
What about the half of this shit I done did to you
Violated and tiptoed into a crib or two
I've come clean to be a bigger individual
Even though you're busy boo, the evening's when I visit you
Kinda makes me feel lucky, 'cause I see niggaz
When you tease 'em with your physical
She wanna rack up her brooms, I ain't got no more room left
Wild drama, section 8 princess
My foreign chick bad, but she been stressed
'Cause it's hard to communicate
'Cause she don't speak-a no English
I been around the world from state to state
But now I'm back bustin' in your bathroom
Got you laughin' in your shower cap
Let's get it on
'Cause I'm leavin' in a hour, fly-through
Don't matter she's mad, even when I holla back
All I really need your attention for a while
And, I bet you I can make you smile
Whenever I'm not around and you feelin' down
Let the thought of me be

I don't wanna see you frown, like them kids watch a clown
I wanna bring you joy and be

Baby, you know my style, you know how I get down
I provide by any means to be

We done been through ups and downs, had drama for a while
I'm just happy I'm around to be

Whenever I'm not around and you feelin' down
Let the thought of me be

I don't wanna see you frown, like them kids watch a clown
I wanna bring you joy and be

Baby, you know my style, you know how I get down
I provide by any means to be

We done been through ups and downs, had drama for a while
I'm just happy I'm around to be

I wanna be the reason you smile
I wanna be the reason you smile
I wanna be the reason you smile
After you wipe away your tears and dry your eyes
Oh, don't even look at me wrong
When I come through the hood
Ain't nothin' changed, still holla at my homies
Oh, and when I hit the block, I still will kill
And I don't want, nigga, but I will
If I got to kill
If niggas get to fuckin' around
If niggas get to fuckin' around
Respect come from admiration and fear
You can admire me if you can catch one in your wig
You see the Testarossa, the toaster's right on my lap
So if a nigga get out of line, a nigga get clapped
I got an arsenal, a infantry, I'm built for this mentally
That's why I'm the general, I do what they pretend to do
Front on me now, nigga, I'll be the end of you
Forget ya enemies and think of what'cha friends'll do
I drop a bag off, then let a mag off
The Heckler & Koch'll tear half of your ass off
I'm not for the games, I'm not for all the playin'
The hollow tips rain when I unleash the pain
Get the message from the lions or get the message from the nine
Paint a picture wit' words, you can see when I shine
Put my back on the wall, nigga, watch me go for mine
I let twenty-one shots off at the same time, yeah
Oh, don't even look at me wrong
When I come through the hood
Ain't nothin' changed, still holla at my homies
Oh, and when I hit the block, I still will kill
And I don't want, nigga, but I will
If I got to kill
If niggas get to fuckin' around
If niggas get to fuckin' around
Where I'm from death is always in the air homie
Nanna love me so you know she say my prayers for me
I come creepin' through the hood wearin' Teflon
Hit the corners motherfuckers get left on
Niggas know, if not, they better check my background
Try and stick me, I fill ya back wit' mac rounds
Ask 'Preme nigga, 50 don't back down
I keep it funky like fiends in a crack house
Cross the line, boy, I'mma air your ass out
Screw ya face at me, I wan' know what that's 'bout
Nigga, I know you ain't mad, I done came up
And if you are, fuck you 'cause I ain't change up
The O.G.'s wanna talk but I don't know these niggas
And I ain't did no business wit' em, I don't owe these niggas
A minute of my time, I get it 'cause I grind
All across the globe like the world's mine, yeah
Oh, don't even look at me wrong
When I come through the hood
Ain't nothin' changed, still holla at my homies
Oh, and when I hit the block, I still will kill
And I don't want, nigga, but I will
If I got to kill
If niggas get to fuckin' around
If niggas get to fuckin' around
Konvict
Now tell me have you ever looked up at an instance
And seen a mac aimin' at'cha head, mayne?
Before you know what life is flashin' and reminiscin
Your body is drippin' and full of lead, mayne
I done been there, I done cocked that
It ain't never been a question, I'm 'bout that
Don't go there, you can cock that
And if you plan to fuck around then reroute that
Youll never catch me ridin' around on these streets
Without a couple metal pieces under my feet
Fully automatic weapons and loaded wit' dumb-d's
Stashed up under the carpet like a can of Seabreeze
50 don't make me ride on these niggas
'Cause I will kill, dip and hide on these niggas
50 don't make me ride on these niggas
'Cause I'll be long gone like the Ripper
So don't even look at me wrong
When I come through the hood
Ain't nothin' changed, still holla at my homies
Oh, and when I hit the block, I still will kill
And I don't want, nigga, but I will
If I got to kill
If niggas get to fuckin' around
If niggas get to fuckin' around
Go, go, go, go go, go, go, shawty
It's your birthday
We gon' party like it's yo birthday
We gon' sip Bacardi like it's your birthday
And you know we don't give a fuck
It's not your birthday!

Niggas heard I fuck with Dre, now they want to show me love
When you sell like Eminem, and the hoes they want to fuck
But homie ain't nothing change hold down, G's up
I see Xzibit in the Cutt that nigga roll that weed up
If you watch how I move you'll mistake me for a player or pimp
Been hit wit a few shells but I don't walk wit a limp
In the hood then the ladies saying "50 you hot"
They like me, I want them to love me like they love 'Pac
But holla in New York them niggas'll tell ya I'm loco
And the plan is to put the rap game in a choke hold
I'm feelin' focused man, my money on my mind
I got a mill out the deal and I'm still on the grind
Now shawty said she feeling my style, she feeling my flow
Her girlfriend want to get bi and they ready to go
You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub
Look mami I got the X if you into taking drugs
I'm into having sex, I ain't into making love
So come give me a hug if you into to getting rubbed
You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub
Look mami I got the X if you into taking drugs

My crib, my cars, my pools, my jewels
Look, nigga, I came up and I ain't changed
And you should love it, way more then you hate it
Nigga you mad? I thought that you'd be happy I made it
I'm that cat by the bar toasting to the good life
You that fagot ass nigga trying to pull me back right?
When my junk get to pumping in the club it's on
I wink my eye at ya bitch, if she smiles she gone
If the roof on fire, let the motherfucker burn
If you talking bout money homie, I ain't concerned

And when you goin' get it in your brain
The gate's wide open and the dog's off the chain
I be that yung'n with that gun-ness, tellin' ya, stop frontin'
I be that yung'n on the run, after I pop some'n
In the Bible I read, death is of the tongue
And if you talk about death enough death is gon' come
Dave taught me how to flow, they shot him in the head
Randy a** was there, now he runnin' scared
Some say I'm gangsta, some say, I'm crazy
If you ask me, I'll say I'm what the hood made me
Now, I can stunt 'til my a** dead broke like Jay-Z
Or put a hundred grand on every n**** head that play me
See, I'm cool with them Hatian mob n****z
Tu say sapa say mavule, and rob n****z
The media be tryin' to make a n**** look bad, wha**up with that?
See my flick, next to bring Papi and Cat
And Montana, I kill 'em with the grammar
I enhanced in the slammer after bangin' them hammers, whattup?

You don't live that, you shouldn't say that
'Cause what come out, your mouth'll get you shot down
Throwin' your money around and we don't play that
Get in our line'll get you shot down

We know where you hang, we know where you stay at
That bulls*** you on'll get you shot down
Here's a few clips that you shouldn't play with
G-Unit, Ruff Ryders'll get you shot down
Ah-yo, f*** y'all n****z talkin' 'bout, think you playin' wit?
Double are, G-UNIT, the same ol' s***

Put the faggots in the ring, watch 'em all quit
All y'all n****z is p****, suck my dick
Ain't notin' but a handful of man still standin'
I remember 50 in a cypher when Onyx was slammin'

Now, we meet again, it's all good my n****
Back to the street again, it's all hood my n****
Knock on wood my n****, we both walk the dog
We ain't get to where we at by luck, s*** was hard

But once we got through the trials it's all smiles
'Til a big type n**** all of a sudden get wild
Now, why you got's to go and take me back to where I came from?
I'ma make you remember, where you know my name from

45th Street, and blaow, blaow, ave
I done ran through your crew and only let off half, n****
You don't live that, you shouldn't say that
'Cause what come out, your mouth'll get you shot down
Throwin' your money around and we don't play that
Get in our line'll get you shot down

We know where you hang, we know where you stay at
That bulls*** you on'll get you shot down
Here's a few clips that you shouldn't play with
G-Unit, Ruff Ryders'll get you shot down

'Cause if my chrome hit a piece of your bone
It's gon' do more than chip, n****

Yea, what the f*** is the problem?
The Porsche is red the buckets is Army
30 shot handguns the gutter is starvin'

N****z like me might rush your apartment

Bloodstains'll f*** up your carpet, brain on the window
I smell murder every time that the wind blow
Tie him to the chair and then knock out his chin bone
I don't want the throne or the crown, I ain't sellin' up
You can have the jail or the ground, you ain't in hell enough
I'm the one that flood the gutters
Better tap your man and let him know P'll love to cut his
And n****z is gettin' shot down, two guns up
Double are, S.P. holdin' D block down
You don't live that, you shouldn't say that
'Cause what come out, your mouth'll get you shot down
Throwin' your money around and we don't play that
Get in our line'll get you shot down

We know where you hang, we know where you stay at

Here's a few clips that you shouldn't play with
G-Unit, Ruff Ryders'll get you shot down

You don't know what you're in for
We get the party rockin', bottles poppin'
Tonight we gon' turn up 'till we twisted, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
System thumpin', the club is jumpin'
Tonight we gon' turn up 'till we twisted, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Let's toast to success and take it a little higher
May tomorrow bring you everything your heart desires
Let your drive and ambition offer you new visions
May your gut-instinct help you make good decisions
This is more than Champagne, this is more than just a glass
This is a symbol of accomplishment we rarely ever had
Let's enjoy tonight like tonight's our last
We can focus on the future and reflect on the past
We done came so far, I mean, look where we are
If they don't call us by name they call us entrepreneurs
From the block to the board room, the hood to the high life
Skyscraper paper, baby, life in the limelight
Want the best of the best, the top of the top
I mean the baddest bitch, you know, the cream of the crop
We gotta hustle and have it, we better than average
More like the elite, my nigga, we gotta eat
Get the party rockin', bottles poppin'
Tonight we gon' turn up 'till we twisted, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
System thumpin', the club is jumpin'
Tonight we gon' turn up 'till we twisted, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
What was once a strike against us has become an advantage
'Cause we grind when we at it like we stone-cold addicts
That mastermind, the mental is oh so essential
Product of the environment, they ain't been what we've been through
I'm fond of the phrase "If there's a will, there's a way"
'Cause we come from the parts where only killas could play
Southside, it's alright, ghetto's my Alma Mater huh? It's alright
We could keep the party jumpin' like this all night
The bottles, just keep 'em coming, baby, let's get right
Let's get it on, play a little Marvin
It's gettin' hot in here, homie, this could be a problem
Keni Burke style, let's keep rising to the top
Let's do it, do it big and let the fuckin' haters watch, oh yeah
This is perfect, this a moment to remember
As we proceed on our money getting agenda
Get the party rockin', bottles poppin'
Tonight we gon' turn up 'till we twisted, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
System thumpin', the club is jumpin'
Tonight we gon' turn up 'till we twisted, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I woke up this morning, this is insane
Rich as a motherfucker and ain't much changed
Open my eyes, no suprise, I'm with a different bitch
Different day, different ass, different tits
Strap under my pillow, I don't want the jit
I'm not supposed to do this shit, but I forget
The true principles of life are supply and demand
Guess if you never sold dope it's hard to understand
My man got knowledge of self, at my back God
Find out today's mathematics when that Mac go off
My temper volatile, grew up a violent child
Fuck a boy scout, I air your ass out
Nigga, nice chain, dice game, try your luck
Shoot a couple head cracks, leave while you up
I'm a fly nigga, my denim vintage
Gold medal around my neck like I won the Olympics
We came from nothing, now they saying we straight
Nigga, hold up, hold on
Hold on
These niggas, they watching every dime we make
Hold up, hold on
Hold on
We want that deluxe apartment in the sky with a clear view
Instead we get the D's in the rear view
We learn to play the game how it's supposed to be played
And so you know, you violate, you supposed to be sprayed
It's not a big deal to me, stay calm
I'll shoot the shit out of a nigga, then call it Barrel Bonds
But, if I don't do this shit myself, bet I'll get it done
Shit on my nigga, you shit on me, we of one
Used to do graffiti, now look we major
Don't make me write my name across your face with a razor
Re-Up, no joke, they say theyis sample the bomb
This shit can take a two and we cut this bitch with a one
Watch the fiends stand in line for the potency
No lactose involved, pure coco leaf
You can sniff that or cook that to my belief
That money coming in like we run the streets
We came from nothing, now they saying we straight
Nigga, hold up, hold on
Hold on
These niggas, they watching every dime we make
Hold up, hold on
Hold on
This shit go how I said, go when it's time to expand
So say it's over your dead body and that's the plan
You a gangster for real, you ready to ride?
Nigga, you gonna die a bad case of too much pride
Check my DNA, homie I'm a different kind
Hit the speed dial, that quick I'll get ya lined
We don't want your block, just cop your work from us
Those niggas you call allies can't be trust
That Rollie all gold, I got the Midas touch
Sometimes it's hard as hell not to touch stuff
On the phone I heard 'Ye smacked the shit outta a kid
Now Jimmy got life, go smack him again
When it's war, it will be war to the bitter end
If they ever say we lose, I start it again
Let's sneak the niggas spray that Semi at your momma crib
With a silencer we couldn't even hear that shit
We came from nothing, now they saying we straight
Nigga, hold up, hold on
Hold on
These niggas, they watching every dime we make
Hold up, hold on
Hold on
I got that animal (animal ambition)
I got that animal (animal ambition)
I got that animal (animal ambition)
I got that animal (animal ambition)
While we were loving the fit
She just want some bread
I ain't talking to tits
And I just want some head
She from a Pirus sip
Where all them niggas wear red
I ain't flying no flags but I'm a gangster bitch
I say say no to drugs then I do that shit
Got a blue fleet of whips
I'm so hood nigga rich
You don't like the way I do it nigga eat your dick
I just call 'em when I want em don't need your bitch
Should see my blood on these diamonds everything proper
Your shit look grown and your shit look copper
It's turning homie that's why your turning on me
Admit it I made it, I can't be faded
I roll it up in public I'm a cancer man
Smoke it out in the open like I'm in Amsterdam
I do a hundred miles an hour switching lens in my lane
See my name around the globe niggas know who I am
I got that animal (animal ambition)



I got that animal (animal ambition)



You say you hustle like a hustle I be moving shit
Had a couch and a U-Haul filled up with bricks
Got them straps and long clips filled up with led
So when we count on the paper it better come back correct
We out in New Orleans baby niggas hungry for brick
I do that knife for stuntin' then get shot in the head
Every hood I go through they fuck with me you dig?
Got the eye of the tiger I'm on that animal shit
I got the heart of a lion and the looks of an elephant
Damn scared of rats, but I'm ready for anything
It's the unit my nigga, take a look at my face
See if you test me they'll arrest me I'll be catching a case
New York is a concrete jungle, where niggas got to get paid
Get in the way of that paper and niggas got to get sprayed
Look at me wrong and your dead
You would be very afraid
I don't know how to behave
I'm tamed fresh out the cage (urrhh)
You forgot my style
Flowers, a funeral service, a kid's in the coffin
It sound so familiar, don't it happen so often?
The shoot-out shit happens, the sister read the eulogy
Couldn't help but think 'nigga better you than me'
.38 ain't got no safety, that bullet ain't got a name on it
But it's hard to miss when that thing got a beam on it
First shot, pop off, everybody popping shots
The glass at the store front, we forgot God was watching
Run, run, hit the gate, D's yelling ''drop it''
Niggas getting jammed up, better that than a jammed up
His momma said a few words to her, he was innocent
She might have heard he did some shit, but never saw no benefits
So in her eyes, he's mommy's little baby
But he was outside talking to niggas crazy
In a room full of people came to pay their respect
I just came in to get a close look at nigga to check
That nigga dead as a doorknob, stiff as a nail
And my man, tomorrow he gon' get out of jail
ROR, trust me nigga I know the law
Release on your own recognizance, that bullshit I'm on it
That's his first taste, I mean his first case
Got knocked with the strap, but not the one that clapped
This nigga here we still got that, yeah
First law in my hood is show no fear
Him and love was closer than we thought, that nigga in here crying
Oh shit, in the store, he probably passed him the iron
These some grimy ass niggas, full breed vultures
Trying to come up, still eating around roaches
Cookie Crisp, Captain Crunch, breakfast of the champions
Lucky charms, stay armed, niggas won't clap you in
We watch the side bitch talking like she a main bitch
His wifey just sat there, preachers weren't saying shit
Right jab, left hook, hand full of weave
This type shit a nigga got to see to believe
These bitches acting up in here
Police they don't fucking care
Homicides snooping around of them, we all with the shit
Cousin back from college saying he gon' get who did this shit
He a ball player nigga, nigga better play ball
You play with the wrong niggas we gon' get to letting off
I done seen enough, feel like it's time for me to split
Hit the parking lot, chill where the weed is lit
Twist the cap, pour out a little liquor
All the theatrics, you know, like that was my nigga
We all can't win, some of us got to lose
Envision a lil' dog barking at a pack of wolves
Cause that's what happened, yeah yeah, that's what happened
He just went on and on till niggas started attacking
Acting like he was the only motherfucker packing
50 bars of pleasure, 50 bars of pain
When I'm dead and I'm gone niggas will remember the name
It's 50, yeah
50 bars of pleasure, 50 bars of pain
When I'm dead and I'm gone niggas will remember the name
It's 50, yeah
Are you ready to win?
Come join the winners circle (Fuck with the winners baby)
Put up your hands for me, baby (Put 'em up)
And do it like we're supposed to
'Cause we're gonna win
Consider this the theme song for victory
The shit you say to yourself when you make history
I'm trying to make it feel like the first time
Like a junkie I'm sort of chasing my first high
I'm focused, I'm disciplined, I'm ready
Mentally on point, sharp as a machete
Hard work, I work hard, I get the job done
It's only one number 1, nigga, I'm number 1
I'm confident, you can call it vain or conceited
Cars, clothes, I need it
Condos, condoms and bad bitches to be with
Run with a winner, baby
Be unconventional, freak me off friends maybe
You can be my girl, be my fair weather friend
Or you could be my, yeah yeah, be my friend to the end
Are you ready to win?
Come join the winners circle
Put up your hands for me, baby
And do it like we're supposed to
'Cause we're gonna win
I got that disease ambition, success is the cure
They wanna win, I gotta win, I sell the shit pure
I got dopeboy bonds, Einstein brains
The heart of a nigga homicidal on the chain gang
I want yachts and drops, I got spots to watch
I wanna see what life is like from the mountain top
Who says sky's the limit? I'm limitless, I just took the pill
Why you think a nigga slow flow so ill?
Be careful, the shit I got is highly contagious
We hustle 'til it had us all locked up in cages
Time gon' fly when a nigga been busy for ages
War stories and wounds, back and forth, a nigga been trading
For the root of all evil, Lord said it's for Satan
We from the bottom, desperation cause moves that we making
I guess it's all risk versus rewards
And a nigga risk it all for the broads (What's up)
Are you ready to win?
Come join the winners circle
Put up your hands for me, baby
And do it like we're supposed to
'Cause we're gonna win
Come join the winners circle
Put up your hands for me, baby
And do it like we're supposed to
'Cause we're gonna win

Nigga you shit on me, I shit on you
You put a hit on me, I put a hit on you
An eye for an eye nigga
Survive the shots or die nigga
 Get 'em Banks!

They can't hold me
I'm Lloyd Banks the one and on-ly
Not your buddy, not your pal, not your ho-mey
But ain't a government around that can control me
Oh no!!!

Uhh, I'm on that "Doggystyle" shit, man I don't love a ho
Poppa wasn't 'round, so I had to let my brother know
Never stay at center, play the back and let your money grow
Most them niggas wouldn't be around if you was bummy yo
Southside Jamaica neighbor yeah that's where I come from
If you see a nigga with me then there's more than one gun
Fly straight soldier, ain'tcha tired of bein the dumb one
Or are you satisfied bein another nigga's Dun-Dunn
We all know friendships turnin sour when you gettin it
Some niggas hate me in the hood, but I don't owe them niggas shit
Smilin all up my face like I don't know them niggas sick
But I can care less, I'm on the Island and I'm gettin rich


Walk it and talk it, spit it how I live it nigga
Came from the country, Dirty South get it nigga
Feds try and question me, they run up in my ho-tel
They said there was a shootin, but they found no shells
New York City hell they throwin niggas under jails
I got love for dem and I ain't even from dere
Now bust a shot for dem boys on da block
I can feel your pain nigga, I'm still in the game nigga
There's somethin bout the sound of a trey-pound
That make me pull up, hop out, and make a nigga lay down
See every time we 'round, you hear some shots go off
And niggas get they chains snatched when they tryin to show off
Shootouts in broad day, we do it the mob way
And come to find out, these niggas softer than Sade'
I'mma keep livin my life with a pistol in my palm
And a wrist full of ice, you can call me a Don motherfucker

We got the Hei-ny
So make one wrong move and you're dy-ing
Ain't no time for coppin a plea and cry-ing
Cause my niggas ain't gon' stop ridin'
So you gone


I got a handgun habit, nigga front I'll let you have it
When the shots go off, cops sayin 50 back at it
I'm allergic to the feathers on these bird-ass niggas (yea)
Front and I'll put your brains on that curb fast nigga
I ain't a marksman, one spark and I spray shit
Nuff rounds from that H-K, I don't play bitch (uh-huh)
Move like I'm militant, back on that gorilla shit
Moody, disrespectful, unruly, but niggas can't move me (yea)
I squeeze 'til I run out of ammo, if it's a problem it's handled
I have your people pourin our liquor and lightin candles
You fuck around I blow your brains on my New York Times
Run home, turn to the sports section and read your mind
It's crystal clear, you should feel when that gat bust
First there's crime scene tape, then you end up in that black hearse
We don't go to funerals, but we'll go to your wake fam
Do your body all banged up, you made a mistake man
Somebody pull the fire alarm, girl, where you from?
'Cause you got this club on fire and outside I bet all they smell is smoke

The way your body roll I'ma lose control
'Cause you got this club on fire and outside I bet all they smell is smoke

Pink diamonds, pink sand, beaches Aruba
Blue sapphires on days when she feeling Hoover
She hood and in the mood when I'm in the mood
Erotic, so exotic, I'm psychotic about it
I don't want forever, I just wanna taste her love sample
That product, I bet a nigga tongue go numb
She's a narcotic, that bomb shit burning, we smoking
My old flame, my Mary Jane, we got a love thing
She ain't jealous, I keep Nina around
In the small of my back in case some shit go down
Right under my Hermes, I'm hearing the word is
Me, I'm a P.I.M.P
I let Trey hit some, then Dre hit some
Then pass it to the homies 'til we all get done
Niggas can't comprehend what this shit 'bout
Police coming, you like, put this shit out
You like smoke and you got me high

High

Girl, what the fuck you done to me?
You got me feeling like you just rolled up for me
You're like smoke and you got me high

High

Girl, what the fuck you done to me?
You got me feeling like you just rolled up for me
You're like smoke
Shawty hot, she full blown, she hot now
100 degrees, that's with or without the top down
But when she get to working her hips you know the temperature rise
Oh lord, soon as she see the dick in her thighs
She like the stones in my cross, she flawless
I'm thinking damn, why would God give one woman all this?
You know I got the kind of conversation that make her feel like she need me
It's complicated, my occupation pimping ain't easy
Facts, I stack racks on racks and racks
Back when I was pumping crack, now my cards are black
Nigga get on my level, bark with the big dogs
If I want it I buy it, I don't care what this shit costs
 a house is not a home without her
I had them panties on the Greyhound filled up with powder
But what she showed what she'll do for me has no limits
Her wanting is temporary cause for sure she gon' get it
You like smoke and you got me high

High

Girl, what the fuck you done to me?
You got me feeling like you just rolled up for me
You're like smoke and you got me high

You gon' make me fill this clip for you
You gon' make me unload then reload 'em number 2
Nigga, I've been known to get them Oxys off
I believe in God, but cross my heart this knock go off
Nigga, I'm from the Mecca of the Groove
The Hoover Crip, I grew up on Figg I had to dodge them County Blues
Live my life behind the rules
Running from the cops, smash the rocks up under my shoes
Spit out the eighth that once, hid in my face
Bounce spring over the gate, didn't get caught
I guess my escape, nigga was fate
I love the block and all the dogs that kept me safe
Now it's, back to adding, points to the crime rate
Get slumped in your drive way
You gon' make me hurt your boy
You gon' make me put that work in boy
You gon' make me get to murkin' boy
Smiling? nigga you gon' make me Flip On You!

Nigga you gon' make me Flip On You!
Nigga you ain't gon' be moving when this clip is through!
Focus on money, I'm in and out ass fast
She loosen up against the wall like a NASCAR crash
Got a bunch of enemies, I count my friends on one hand
Ghetto philosphy, watch me, I got a hundred scams
Like we could make a few dollars, that there a hundred grams
I got a gift, I communicate with the afterlife
Apparently, your bitch ass ain't acting right
Niggas killed your man, you ain't gon' get him back?
What? You is tired out? Why you ain't get around to that?
You wonder, I travel, I have a destination
I'll be a street legend new version of Pappy Mason
My style? It'll never die, boy I'm immortal
You shoot me down, I'll get back up and keep coming for you
Man on fire, hitman for hire
Them niggas got happy they thought I was gon' retire
Now they bitch giving me head, I'm the man, a man admires
What's up?
Smiling? nigga you gon' make me Flip On You!
You gon' make me flip this knife out do some shit to you!
Nigga you gon' make me Flip On You!
Nigga you gon' make me-you gon' make me Flip On You!
Nigga you gon' make me Flip On You!

Nigga you gon' make me Flip On You!
Nigga you ain't gon' be moving when this clip is through!
I'm still a rider, I'm still rolling
A nigga still hold the steel, that's how I'm owning
You chase the hoes, I chase the paper
You chase the hoes, I chase the paper
You chase the hoes, I chase the paper
You a sucker for love, nigga, I'm money making
I'm still a baller, I'm still balling
That's five times I ain't picked up, your bitch still calling
I'm super ghetto, I'm still with the shit
Still pass the steel to my nigga, hit a lick
We still mob, niggas steal stuff
We still deal after deal, shit is no problem
He still love her, she ain't shit
Get her a pair of Louboutins, she suck a dick
Still real niggas, still will kill
Tote the steel bitch don't squeal, get your cap peeled
The Mac filled, black talons, hollow tips
Copper-tops, get your ass popped, watch a body drop
You chase the hoes, I chase the paper
You chase the hoes, I chase the paper
I'm still a rider, I'm still rolling
A nigga still hold the steel, that's how I'm owning
You chase the hoes, I chase the paper
You chase the hoes, I chase the paper
You chase the hoes, I chase the paper
You a sucker for love, nigga, I'm money making
I'm clean as a motherfucker, still getting my hands dirty
Bitches they wanna fuck, grab a glass, you looking thirsty
See I'm a gangsta, you soft as R&B; singers
I'm at a war with the banger, in the club with the shanker
Mask on, lone ranger, scope on the K, long ranger
Rather be alive and rich than die and be famous
Live my life in the fast lane, I crash into anything
I ain't here to entertain when I let them bullets sing
Rims on, Rida Gang, slap the fuck out of you, nigga
Trying to pull out your pistol when you know that you're lame
You chasing these bitches instead of chasing your paper
Niggas taking your bitches while they taking your paper
I'm gone
You chase the hoes, I chase the paper
You chase the hoes, I chase the paper
I'm still a rider, I'm still rolling
A nigga still hold the steel, that's how I'm owning
You chase the hoes, I chase the paper
You chase the hoes, I chase the paper
You chase the hoes, I chase the paper
You a sucker for love, nigga, I'm money making
She on my leg like a little kid
She hump my leg like a horny pit
Pitbull in a skirt, yeah, I'm a magnet
Now I ain't running after no broads, she stuck on my dick
I'm a different breed, blame it on my genes
Money in my jeans, pockets turn her eyes green
She's seeing dollar signs, I'm seeing reasons why
Never had to stress no pussy, I'm one of a kind
Pretty nigga with a gorgeous gun
You die a beautiful death, pull a stunt, look
There ain't a bitch more dime than me
The thirst is real, she knocking over drinks to get next to me
While you
You chase the hoes, I chase the paper
You chase the hoes, I chase the paper
I'm still a rider, I'm still rolling
A nigga still hold the steel, that's how I'm owning
You chase the hoes, I chase the paper
You chase the hoes, I chase the paper
You chase the hoes, I chase the paper
You a sucker for love, nigga, I'm money making
Ghetto niggas still'll pick a penny up
You outside chasing them hoes throwing your Henny up
Little homie loading a semi up
Catch him all after the club, tell him to ante up
Anyway, each and every day, I'm looking for a better way
You owe me, you better pay
Ghost, let the beretta spray
Hood want uncut dope and some better yay
I ain't chasing pussy, never have
Hustle hard, take a break, run and get some head and ass
Still robbing, still rolling, still need a mask
Still popping, still slinging, still need the cash
You chase the hoes, I chase the paper
You chase the hoes, I chase the paper
I'm still a rider, I'm still rolling
A nigga still hold the steel, that's how I'm owning
You chase the hoes, I chase the paper
You chase the hoes, I chase the paper
You chase the hoes, I chase the paper
You a sucker for love, nigga, I'm money making
Don't worry 'bout how I get my money, bitch, just know I get my money
Don't worry 'bout I spend my money, boy, I got a lot
Don't worry 'bout that car I drive, don't worry 'bout that bike I ride
Don't worry 'bout them diamonds in that bezel on my watch
Don't worry 'bout it, don't worry 'bout it
Don't worry 'bout a mothafuckin' thing
Don't worry 'bout it, don't worry 'bout it
We got a strap up in here if niggas playing
When time pass and I'm not around, niggas saying I'm out of town
Probably moving them bricks around, they swear they know how I get down
Don't worry 'bout what I'm doing, don't worry 'bout what I'm doing
My closet full of that fly shit, black card when I buy shit
Sell the shit you get high with, these niggas on my dick
Don't worry 'bout what I'm doing, don't worry 'bout what I'm doing
That's your bitch, I understand, I've seen it all on Instagram
I'm just from the past, I done been all in that ass
Don't worry 'bout what I'm doing, don't worry 'bout what I'm doing
Don't worry 'bout how I get my money, bitch, just know I get my money
Don't worry 'bout I spend my money, boy, I got a lot
Don't worry 'bout that car I drive, don't worry 'bout that bike I ride
Don't worry 'bout them diamonds in that bezel on my watch
Don't worry 'bout it, don't worry 'bout it
Don't worry 'bout a mothafuckin' thing
Don't worry 'bout it, don't worry 'bout it
We got a strap up in here if niggas playing
Don't be worry 'bout my record deals cause I still got my plug
Don't be worry 'bout my bitch strippin', she get money out that club
Don't be worry 'bout my partners and 'em, we get money, we eating
You talk shit 'bout a real nigga, bitch, you must be tweaking
Don't be worried 'bout my whereabouts, money all I care about
Keeping it real in my neighborhood, play with me and I'mma air it out
Why you worry 'bout my money, nigga? Bitch, you think I'm broke?
The Fed worry 'bout what I'm doing, think I'm selling dope
I may be and I may not, go to jail I may rot
I ain't never gon' snitch, nigga, never been no bitch nigga
I got big guns, need a extra large, y'all niggas got question marks
Talking down on a real nigga, that's how you get a hater charged
Don't worry 'bout how I get my money, bitch, just know I get my money
Don't worry 'bout I spend my money, boy, I got a lot
Don't worry 'bout that car I drive, don't worry 'bout that bike I ride
Don't worry 'bout them diamonds in that bezel on my watch
Don't worry 'bout it, don't worry 'bout it
Don't worry 'bout a mothafuckin' thing
Don't worry 'bout it, don't worry 'bout it
We got a strap up in here if niggas playing
Don't worry 'bout what they talking 'bout
Don't tell me what that bitch done said
I'm done with her, you can go with her
I'm leaving here with another bitch
Don't worry 'bout how they look at me
My diamonds on, damn, look at me
These pussy nigga be shooked at me
Wanna judge and throw the book at me
Don't worry 'bout it, I ain't worried 'bout it
Had time to talk to my legal team
Don't worry 'bout it, I ain't worried 'bout it
Ain't shit they could do to me
Still rocking, still rolling
We holding, bill folding, you know it
When I start to ball out money start to fall out
Throw it up, it fall out the sky
Baddest bitches go all out, whole bar get bought out
That's what I call my lifestyle
Don't worry 'bout how I get my money, bitch, just know I get my money
Don't worry 'bout I spend my money, boy, I got a lot
Don't worry 'bout that car I drive, don't worry 'bout that bike I ride
Don't worry 'bout them diamonds in that bezel on my watch
Don't worry 'bout it, don't worry 'bout it
Don't worry 'bout a mothafuckin' thing
Don't worry 'bout it, don't worry 'bout it
We got a strap up in here if niggas playing
They say this is a big, rich town
I just come from the poorest part
Bright lights, city life, I gotta make it
This is where it goes down
I just happen to come up hard
Legal or illegal, baby, I gotta make it
I never took a straight path nowhere, life's full of twist and turns
Bumps and bruises, I lived, I learned
I'm from that city full of yellow cabs and skyscrapers
It's hard to get a start in these parts without paper
Homie, I grew up in hell, a block away from heaven
That corner every 15 minutes it move a seven
Pure snow, bag it then watch it go
Occupational options, get some blow or some hoes
Shoot the bowl or the strap, learn to rap or to jack
Fuck it, man, in the mean time go ahead and pump a pack
This my regal royal flow, my James Bond bounce
That 007, that 62 on my count
I'm a undercover liar, I lie under the covers
Look a bitch in the eyes and tell her "baby, I love it"
You're my inspiration, you're my motivation
You're the reason that I'm moving with no hesitation
They say this is a big, rich town
I just come from the poorest part
Bright lights, city life, I gotta make it
This is where it goes down
I just happen to come up hard
Legal or illegal, baby, I gotta make it
I gotta hustle through the hustle and bust while I make a move
Manuever around the rats and wolves, I'm from the school
Of hard knocks, shots pop, bodies drop
Graveyard, pick a plot 'cause niggas want your spots
I'm trying to stack shit then I go legit
Hollow tip, stuff 'em in a clip case niggas trip
My cocaine endeavours give me corporate ties
I'm supposed to lose, watch me win against the odds
All I got is my word, balls and my instinct
I'm trying to make it, we already made it my friends think
We already on top, I got a bigger plan
No more controlled substances or hand to hand
White collar visions, game changing mission
Big risks, big wins, equal bigger living
Perfect position, watch me transition
From caterpillar to butterfly in the sky
Nigga, you pussy, you scared
I can hear your heartbeat
Why the fuck would you come around here?
I can hear your heartbeat
Yeah, you know a dog sense fear
I can hear your heartbeat
You bark while we bite around here
I can hear your heartbeat
We ain't cut from the same cloth, we into different shit
I want the bread, you want the bitch
Come out your mouth slick I'll get you hit
My niggas hungry, they hit a lick
Fuck who you're with, niggas'll dump a clip
We by the school yard waiting for you to get your kid
I caught a A1 felony on my last bid
Kept calm, made bond, I'm on that shit
You think my rap shit a gimmick, I ain't seen parole in a minute
Truth be told these niggas is hoes
Once the shit set off, man, anything goes
Through the windows of your soul, the eyes never lie
If you ain't scared to die, nigga, why would you cry?
Nigga, you pussy, you scared
I can hear your heartbeat
Why the fuck would you come around here?
I can hear your heartbeat
Yeah, you know a dog sense fear
I can hear your heartbeat
You bark while we bite around here
I can hear your heartbeat
30 something and you ain't even open your mouth yet
Social media is giving cowards an outlet
See him in person, say something, I doubt that
Rather get caught with it than get caught without that
Trying to back peddle and stumble on the curve
You starin' at the ground, you mumblin' your words
Literally I can see your heart pumpin' through your shirt
Pussy your whole life, you always been a bird
Scared for so long it's all up in your nerves
Screw 9-1-1, you probably call up the reserves
And I'm killin' you first, if we ever do a purge
And you know what it is, kid, whenever we emerge
And I'm tragical, traumatical, no match, incompatible
Nigga, you vaginal
Nigga, you pussy, you scared
I can hear your heartbeat
Why the fuck would you come around here?
I can hear your heartbeat
Yeah, you know a dog sense fear
I can hear your heartbeat
You bark while we bite around here
I can hear your heartbeat
Money for bail, money to bail
Dead or in jail, Heaven or Hell
FEDs on my coat tail, snitches given court tells
Kept fate when all hope fail
Niggas rattin', all they missin' is the tail like Mickey Mouse
Call me Mickey Mantle when I bat you in the mouth
I bring them hammers out, we ain't trying to build a house
Niggas on them songs rappin' shit they ain't about
I'm from the N-O, we don't scrap, we bang it out
Bang, I'm the one that came in your house for the chickens
Left a nigga brains hangin' out like we chillin'
Stankin' like shipments, over my shillings
Hump your security, Rida gang in the building
Nigga, you pussy, you scared
I can hear your heartbeat
Why the fuck would you come around here?
I can hear your heartbeat
Yeah, you know a dog sense fear
I can hear your heartbeat
You bark while we bite around here
I can hear your heartbeat

Huge rocks poking, I don't need an AC

Acting like you will never do it
Don't wind up on the wall over music

Blink, a kilo is out the door
Don't fuck around when I'm hustling bo
Got a hundred mill in my stash, nigga

These hoes ain't loyal, want bread winners
Hit Perfection, throw bread, nigga
That's why S550 getting head, nigga
European bitches crazy ass with funny accents
Euros in my back, trunk full of white boy, One Direction
On that I-9-5, Heckler for protection
One minute I'm home, next I'm in Rome, nigga

Passport gang, my phone's on roam, nigga

G5 flight, I'm in my zone, nigga

Why your bitch giving me dome, nigga?



Rock O's, but you ain't even know it

Everything brand new, nigga

Big watch, I'm big time

My neck blink and my whip shine

Stick it in the freezer 'til it get silent

All my life I've been grinding

Ring around the rosies, pockets full of OZ's
Niggas gettin' cake made
Fuck with the homies while I got it on me

Girl face on my time piece, ridin' around with my grimey's

All my niggas crazy stupid, koo koo got a loose screw

My bitch come from Honolulu, with that dope ball in her doo doo

You run like a bitch, you ain't 'bout that shit
Hey, hey, hey, I'll catch you another day, day, day
It's the Unit back to the bullshit

Nothing in life is out of bounds
AK hold about a hundred rounds
60 shots like KD at the Rucker's
Okay when I see you on respirators
Southside nigga 'til the day I'm gone
Indulge in the violence when the drama on
Yeah, these rap niggas lukewarm
I'm too sleaves of dope when the mic on


Don't Tweet me, see me when you see me
Down to make the news just to say that I'm on TV
This clip rated R, niggas PG
Them shells burn like a bootleg CD
Fuck love, I want the money
When you get too much of it they gon' say you acting funny
''Kidd, how you feel now that the Unit's back?''
Like a million bucks, motherfucker, do the math

Coldblooded, boy, my heart don't feel shit
Get with me, ask 50, I take the hit (real quick)
Balenciagas you could still get your ass kicked
Take a rapper nigga bitch and make a real flick
I know I'm different from what you usually been dealing with
Don't need a mic, give me some white to make a million with
Single burrough, 6 shots on the Brooklyn Bridge
I let the nigga Drake tell you what I just did


Nigga, getting money new to you
I give a fuck if shit get ugly, it'll be a beautiful funeral
You fit the script I'm gon' assume it's true
Can't manuever through the street without a strategy
Ain't nobody to tutor you
And man was lucky Unit's through
You know how he flows
15 years switching dealers like casinos
And my goon'll clip you in the arm
I'm out the country every week and dumping ash on the Autobahn
Autopilot's always on, rather bet a living, I've been [?]
Greenbills calling me all day long, this is homocide
More tears in your mama eyes
More reasons to wake up, real niggas arrive

Free again

With all my precious freedom
It's Coca the don nigga

I move rhymes like retail, make sure shit sell
From where we at to my man's cell
I move rhymes like retail, make sure shit sell
From where we at to my man's cell (Free)
Straight outta cell 12 a hell fell on my lap
A nigga was born to rap 'bout drug tales and all the rats
This is for Chef Jr., now that's Italiana
Chicken Parmesan and bocce with my paesanas
I told Manuel AzaÃƒÂ±a I'll die with my honor
Six bad bitches, some marijuana, with ? Can find us
If you could see the pictures and the scriptures that these bitches sent me
Hopped in the Ghost, my wiz jumped in the sister Bentley
When Suge had the Row, Jay start the Roc
I was in the car ? Fuck the cops
With the killer cross, had Iverson on the block
Graced the cover of The Source, tell me that ain't hot
When in for RICO, kilos, wish they gave me the max
Fuck them T.O.'s, and see hoes for hatin' new crack
Four months on the toilet shit, I can do that
Came with thirty, left with three, now how the fuck he do that?
Most these niggas in the Fed shoulda been in the State
Off The Texas to Brazil, now we raisin' the stakes
I seen Gordouli, know that nigga big like Chapo
Shout out to you know who, let me fuck in the chapel
Esa es ? First thing in the mornin'
Tried to send me to the shoe for the first pair of Jordans
I had a thing for the secretary, wassup Ms. Jordan?
All that ass in them pants had you feelin' important
Left with J's on my feet, J's, J's on my feet
Straight out the cage, sun raised on the beach
And I ain't got to lie, my son raised on the beach
Crib with the elevator, Gabe on the piece

It's goin' down, down, it's goin' down
Once again New York city (free)
It's goin' down, down, it's goin' down
I move rhymes like retail, make sure shit sell
From where we at to my man's cell
I move rhymes like retail, make sure shit sell
From where we at to my man's cell

Gun choke, move dope, niggas know my repertoire
Bulletproof smart car, level six AR
Cocktail, Molotov, burn heat, turn heat
Revolve, cock, bang, revolve, it's off
Cocaine, medating, codeine better lean
The fuck out my way, drive the bricks down the highway
It's an anthem when I rant, fuck you think I am, Kanye?
I had them wearing vests, now these niggas wear dresses (Free)
I take you back to the essence,
Free of charge a nigga so large, these niggas is stretching, I bless 'em
The pounds the purple with profits precise
With precision, we'll move you up the pillar, you get that right
Money motivation, this bread in the basket
Go ahead, say something 'bout it while you gettin' your ass kicked
Niggas back on the New York bullshit
My little man post up in the bank with a full clip, he let it off

It's goin' down, down, it's goin' down

It's goin' down, down, it's goin' down
I move rhymes like retail, make sure shit sell
From where we at to my man's cell
I move rhymes like retail, make sure shit sell

Dj Kay Slay, The Drama King
Fat Joe, 50 Cent
New York City, had to happen
It's about politics
They can make a wrong teaching way to right
Or right situation wrong
Depending upon the players involved, politics
Wack 100, whadup?
Free again! (Free again)
(Back to being free again



Hell, I done been to jail, I ain't scared
Mama checking in my bedroom, I ain't there
I got a head with no screws in it
Motherfuckers thinking they can stop 50, they losing it
Lil' nigga named Ja think he live like me
Talking 'bout he left the hospital, took 9 like me
I'm on a hard bench, tryna' sleep in the pen
Man, how the fuck did I get here again?
First thing in a morning, it's the fuck shit
They called the case, I got confronted by a tough snitch
He told me do it, 1 click, you ain't tell me to do it
You ain't a shooter, you a sherm nigga, you fuckin' loser
I fly a kite, my little man cut his sister up
He loves his bitch, you snatch her, he'll start switching up
I'm cool, I just wait for my next court day
I bet he catch amnesia, then do this shit at leisure
Surrounded by blood, crips, kings, and yetis
Gym stars open niggas up like barettas
I'm tryna' be easy
But every now and then I gotta put it in, please believe me
You get to looking at me strange, I'm prepared Jack
Or buck 50, keep the change he can wear that

This is murder this is not music
I had the style 10 years ago
I just didn't use it
You niggas forgot how I do it
Well I do it like there' nothin' to it
Ye, all I'mma do is this. I'mma keep countin' money
I don't give a fvck if it make you sick to see a nigga win
I'mma make you watch me win over and over again
You already know what it is with me motherfvcker
This year, goddamn it, you motherfvckers is making me lose count man
Gotta start this shit over, I'm licking my fingers
I'm gettin'... I got 100 dollar bills, for real nigga
All I'mma do is this man. You hear that sound in the background?
I'mma do this shit till my thumb get tired
I'mma take a break when I get past your momma house nigga
When I count more than your momma house
I'mma take a break. [?] Hand me that money over there
What we gon' do? All year long. It's back to 50, you already know
Get the money, and shut the fvck up
Watch me do what I'm doin', cause niggas can't stop nothin' that I'm doin', nothing I'm doing. Right after you get in the way
We gon' start shooting again like it's nothing changed
We went through that whole "Kumbaya my lord
Let's be friends by the fire". It's over nigga
Back to the script, you know how this shit go
How much is that? Oooh, if you could see me right now
I got a alligator on nigga!
You, you think it should go different? See that's where you go wrong
When you think... Who the fvck asked you to think nigga!?
Now you think that, writing comments and tweeting
And your hashtags and... You know what the fvck you do nigga
Let me do what I do.
Don't make this complicated
My old school candy painted
I hustle hard
When I come through they like "oh my God that nigga clean"
From the beginning It Was Written I suppose
I break a whole on the 36 oz
And move it, I'm a hustler, baby
I'm a hustler, baby
My mind on the money, I ain't tripping on the hoes
I blow a whole lot of paper on clothes
But dig it, I'm a hustler, baby
I'm a hustler, baby
I come through, I had the hoes like "who he?"
Seats in the old school Louis
Shoes and the belt buckle Louis
We don't need more details now do we?
Let 'em sag, my swag is True Religion
You gonna need Cartier frames to see my vision
It smells like cream mixed with weed, this is classy and hood
Drama llama time, nigga, what's good?
Domino's, motherfucker, it's time to collect
Stack paper like I'm trying to fix the national debt
I'm just doing what I wanna do, I trip these set
This is 50 on that Muammar Gaddafi shit
From the beginning It Was Written I suppose
I break a whole on the 36 oz
And move it, I'm a hustler, baby
I'm a hustler, baby
My mind on the money, I ain't tripping on the hoes
I blow a whole lot of paper on clothes
But dig it, I'm a hustler, baby
I'm a hustler, baby
Get on my level, bitch, I'm careful who I kick it with
We talk market and distribution and politics
Got a chip on my shoulder, chip off the old block
I sell the chip of a whole rock, 10 dollars a pop
I'm a magnet, the bitch can't help but watch me
Socks, drawers, undershirt, Versace, Versace, Versace
Designer threads in every form of fashion
I express myself so the question I'm askin'
Is this flip or the next flip tailor 50 shit?
We ain't promised tomorrow, nigga, go on and get the shit
That skull and bones, that Alexander McQueen thing
In case you ain't notice this a Queens thing
From the beginning It Was Written I suppose
I break a whole on the 36 oz
And move it, I'm a hustler, baby
I'm a hustler, baby
My mind on the money, I ain't tripping on the hoes
I blow a whole lot of paper on clothes
But dig it, I'm a hustler, baby
I'm a hustler, baby
Oh, it's cold out here
It's my kind of weather, I'm cold blooded
It's 50
When I come through you see me
In the Suburbans that's bulletproof, bomb proof, level 6, what else?
When I go hard I go hard
When I don't want you to see me I switch it up
I'm in that black on black Porsche Panamera
In the back like "ooh wee"
We rolling
I hustle, man, it's what I do, man
What, niggas gon' try and tell me how to do this?
Go, go, go, go go, go, go, shawty
It's your birthday
We gon' party like it's yo birthday
We gon' sip Bacardi like it's your birthday
And you know we don't give a fuck
It's not your birthday!

If you watch how I move you'll mistake me for a player or pimp
Been hit wit a few shells but I don't walk wit a limp
In the hood then the ladies saying "50 you hot"
They like me, I want them to love me like they love 'Pac
But holla in New York them niggas'll tell ya I'm loco
And the plan is to put the rap game in a choke hold
I'm feelin' focused man, my money on my mind

Look, nigga, I came up and I ain't changed
And you should love it, way more then you hate it
Nigga you mad? I thought that you'd be happy I made it
I'm that cat by the bar toasting to the good life
You that fagot ass nigga trying to pull me back right?
When my junk get to pumping in the club it's on
I wink my eye at ya bitch, if she smiles she gone
If the roof on fire, let the motherfucker burn
If you talking bout money homie, I ain't concerned

Get her ass shots, throw D's on her
Them shoes more than you think though
