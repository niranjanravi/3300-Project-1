 Mama, Mama!

You get that money out my pants last night?
(Nah I didn't get no money out your pants
And quit yelling at me!)
Ain't nobody hollerin' at you!
I had a dream that rap wouldn't work
I woke up on the block
Had to hit it with the fork
Skrrr, skrrr, skrrr, skrrr, skrrr
Hit it with the fork
Skrrr, skrrr, skrrr, skrrr, skrrr
Hit it with the fork
Rap don't work, records ain't bein' sold
So much money on me, it won't even fold
So much money on me, it won't even fold
So much money on me, it won't even fold
So much money on me, it won't even fold
So much money on me, it won't even fold
I got Medusa on my sneakers
My dick up like "nice to meet ya"
100K for a feature, hundred K's at my leisure
Then we aim at your people
I be higher than a eagle
When I'm sipping on that codeine
Free my nigga Siegel
I am ridin' on a jet, headin' to that Costa
Soon as I land I be in that Testarossa
If I die tonight, you gon' see some flicks in Ghosta
I'm the man in my city, same thing in South Dakota
Man I'm running up that check, show you how I do it
I drink red bitches, I don't drink Red Bulls
Man they tried to give me wings, but I already had some
I'm all that and then some
My trap house is my income, and it's booming!
I had a dream, rap wouldn't work
Woke up on the block
Hit it with the fork
Skrrr, skrrr, skrrr
Hit it with the fork
Skrrr, skrrr, skrrr
Hit it with the fork
Rap don't work, records ain't bein' sold
So much money on me, it won't even fold
So much money on me, it won't even fold
So much money on me (2 Chainz!) It won't even fold
I'm ballin' like Mr. Clean
I gotta keep my kitchen clean
God bless me like I'm finna sneeze
Got to weigh me on a triple beam
D-boy in parenthesis
All gold in my Mr. T's
2 Chainz, two pinky rings
My trigger finger's like a lemon squeeze (baow!)
Climax! Make your main ho my side-chick
I'm so high, your whore get hijacked
And my vision is Pyrex
I do it big like a 5X
Killed they ass with the eyepatch
I got bad bitches on my side
I done fucked around and got sidetracked
My first night, I spent five stacks
Next night I forgot to count
I'm so hot, who gon' put the fire out?
I'm the fireman, I put fire out
Got a pole in my basement
Tipped your girl like Malaya now
Ridin' on these motherfucka's until they blow my tires out
My wrist deserve a shout-out
I'm like "what up, wrist?"
My stove deserve a shout-out
I'm like "what up, stove?"
All this jewelry on then I'm out cold
So much money on me, it won't even fold!
I had a dream, rap wouldn't work
Woke up on the block
Hit it with the fork
Skrrr, skrrr, skrrr
Hit it with the fork
Skrrr, skrrr, skrrr
Hit it with the fork
Rap don't work, records ain't bein' sold

Money's the motivation, money's the conversation
You on vacation, we gettin' paid so
We on paycation, I did it for the fam'
It's whatever we had to do, it's just who I am
Yeah, it's the life I chose
Gunshots in the dark, one eye closed
And we got it cooking like a one-eyed stove
You can catch me kissing my girl with both eyes closed
Perfecting my passion, thanks for asking
Couldn't slow down so we had to crash it
You used plastic, we 'bout cash
I see some people ahead that we gon' pass yeah!
I never feared death or dying
I only fear never trying
I am whatever I am,
Only God can judge me now
One shot, everything rides on tonight
Even if I've got three strikes, I'ma go for it
This moment, we own it
And I'm not to be played with
Because it can get dangerous
See these people I ride with
This moment, we own it
And the same ones that I ride with,
Be the same ones that I die with
Put it all out on the line with,
If you looking for me you can find Wiz
In the new car or in the crown with
My new broad, that's a fine chick
And the wonder squad, I'm down with (And no way around it)
What you say, tell me what you say
Working hard, reppin' for my dogs, do this everyday,
Takin' off, looking out for all, makin' sure we ball,
Like the mob all you do is call
Catch you if you fall, Young Khalifa
I never feared death or dying
I only fear never trying
I am whatever I am,
Only God can judge me now
One shot, everything rides on tonight
Even if I've got three strikes, I'ma go for it
This moment, we own it
And I'm not to be played with
Because it can get dangerous
See these people I ride with
This moment, we own it
This the biggest day of my life
We got big guns, been graduated from knives
It's the day in the life and I'm ready to ride
Got the spirit, I'm feelin' like a killer inside uh
Financial outbreak, I'm free but I ain't out yet
Ridin' with the plug so I'm close to the outlet
At the red light, rims sittin' off set
I look better on your girl (Than her outfit)
Stuck to the plan, always think that we would stand up, never ran
We the fam' and loyalty never change up
Been down since day one, look at where we came from
Jumpin' out on anybody who try to say somethin' one thing about it
Got a problem, I got the same one
Money rolls, we fold
Plenty clubs we closed
Follow the same code
Never turn our backs, our cars don't even lose control
One shot, everything rides on tonight
Even if I've got three strikes, I'ma go for it
This moment, we own it
And I'm not to be played with
Because it can get dangerous
See these people I ride with
This moment, we own it
This moment we own it
I ride or die for mine
I'm ride or die material
One life to live so here we go
This moment we own it
I'm blessed, some might say I'm lucky
I'm blessed, some might say I'm lucky
Every cents huffy, pockets on husky
Shawty don't trust me, I break hearts often
If you look at my pockets you a weight watcher
From a dishwasher to a kingpin
Remember how the scene end and how this thing is
Trucks backed in, that mean them things in
Now it's duffle bags full of green men
I swear I ain't lying if my daddy hadn't died
He'd tell ya I had em' hooked like Kareem did
Two kids later, I mature like fine wine in the basement
Vino, different kind of pinot
Tried to stack c-note after c-note
I'm tryna make it count like a free throw after free throw
Line, it's a thin one between
Getting high and committing crimes
Let a nigga live
I've been locked up more rapping
Than I did tryna get a brick (Fuck this shit)
I remember when I believed in me
What am I supposed to do?
Uh, now when the ones that didn't see me
They want a verse or two
Shit, what am I supposed to do?
Put 'em in a fucking hearse or two
I'm the illest, I wrote that shit in cursive too
And I smoke just to ease the pain
So hungry I used to try to eat the rain
Well at least until the pizza came
Or at least until polices came
Undercovers outside my momma yard
And all the guns is in Kesha's name
In Jesus's name I pray
I say that a couple times a day
When it's time to eat, when it's time to lay
And when it's daytime it ain't my time of day, uh
I heard my little big cousin mad at me
I call him little big 'cause he younger than me
But he big, he was the high school team captain
Didn't graduate but sometimes things happen
And whatever happen that was the worst day
And who know what was going on in the first place
I love and helped raise my nigga
This year forgot to call him on his birthday
It's hard to explain my new lifestyle
My partner locked down, got a phone and an iPod
He called to tell me happy new years
I had to tell him nigga, it's March
We had similar stars
But I ain't figured his part
They had dough and we didn't
How did it dissolve, alka-seltzer
This is the outroduction
Niggas stab you in your back like acupuncture
Say what the fuck going on, man it must be twerk season
Something in the air, it must be twerk season
'Cause they dancin', dancin', for no reason

Niggas stunt on you, front on you
Niggas can't even ball but bunt on you

I hope you get testicular cancer in the brain
Dickhead, by the time you get fed
I be somewhere with a six pack and a six pack
Her lips and her hips thick
My boxers are covered in her lipstick
Her pussy fat but eatin' good, so that's a misprint
I'm a misfit, I did it and beyond
Shiny watch, lookin' like the old Diddy on my arm
Highly flammable, barely keep getting in Canada
Run this rap shit, I got stamina
You an amateur, I aim at 'cha,
I bang at 'cha, hope a plane hit 'cha
Fuck you and whoever came witcha
Trying to express the beautiful pain witcha
Like a tattoo of a framed picture
Of a dead homie, maybe a family member
I got some gambling scriputres like um
Scared money don't make no money
Bet now motherfucker gonna take them from me
Got ounces of loud you can hear me smoking
I be coughing on the crowd you can hear me choking nigga
Oh I feel so fly
Came so far, but I still wanna fly
So come on in this car, this yacht, this plane
You see what this beautiful pain, provide
Baby look into my eyes
I'd be the man or I'd rather die, rather die
You talk about hurting
Try washing clothes with no detergent
Daddy deserted so now we serve sandwich serving
Dreaming we had a furnace,
It's cold we sleeping on the curtains,
What can I say it got me highly motivated
Mama two job working, banana companies emerg
Need a two week notice
Before they say don't need your service
I'm too young to have burdens
But still feel I should be further
But who am I kidding
I had bridges but I just burned them
My mama need earnings
Ain't have no time for higher learning
Call me a hypocrite, backslider
You name it I done heard it
The way that they speak of me
You think I've already murdered
It's hard to be laid back
My haters so assertive, but

Honey, we got off on the wrong foot, baby
'Cause the relationship has been so good lately
If I don't do what I do
Then who's gon' put food on the table?
It is what it is, I'm just handling biz
But I do what I do so we can live
I only do what I do so we can live
I only do what I do so we can live

I only do what I do so we can live
Mama don't work, heater don't work
Police pulled me over and said
He seen weed on my shirt
I pray to the lord and ask for forgiveness
If he popped my trunk I can get a life sentence
He came a little closer and told me that he smellin' it
I said "I rolled one up
I won't insult your intelligence
But I threw it out the window half a mile ago"
He asked me when the last time I smoke
I said a while ago
Forgive me officer
I'm stressin' and my pockets sore
Hurtin'
Chillin' with my dog like a fuckin' Labrador
He said he ain't with the bull, matador
Looked at the top of my car
Like what this ladder for?
I told him I was puttin' goals up in the mornin'
And I'm goin' to my uncle's house
To see if he can join me
The officer got a call so he was needed
And he told me slow it down
And I told him please believe it
Then I proceeded to go to my uncle's house
Well it really wasn't my uncle
It was a junkie's house
He got a badass niece with a donkey now
Pullin' out the parking lot
Headed to the other spot
Out all night, addict with the addicts
'Causin' Havoc, I'm a Prodigy

Sippin' and my soda pink, you niggas is toilet seat
Check my resume, it used to say I sold quarter keys
Conduct disorderly, stayin' in the trap house
Trips went to work, I'm so glad that it mapped out
Honey, we got off on the wrong foot, baby
'Cause the relationship has been so good lately
If I don't do what I do
Then who's gon' put food on the table?
It is what it is, I'm just handling biz
But I do what I do so we can live
I only do what I do so we can live
I only do what I do so we can live

And you the last of a dyin' breed
Follow caine like a menace to society
The richest nigga in the city cosignin' me
My shampoo days done showed me the way
As I pray, lord willin' but the killer's still vague
How can there be closure when the shooter's still in questionin'
Your niggas got rich, but when you died them niggas owed you
And everything I see is adding up to what you told me
I'm ramblin', tryna keep it to myself

Rest in peace to my n****, you da realest, dawg
You da realest, dawg, you da realest, dawg

You the realest, ain't no gimmicks, I got illness
If this rap game is my building
I got tenants, I got tenants
I got "gettin' it" in my spirit
I'm winning to the end
And I just made me some millions
And this only the beginning
Rest in peace to all my n****s
They died while they was servin'
Rest in peace to all the soldiers
That died in the service
I died in her cervix
Chicken's, no churches
Never seen a man cry 'til you seen a man die
Closed curtain
Closed casket, blasted, breathe again, Braxton
Heart filled with pa**ion, neck filled with mansions
Nonchalant and sarcastic, my bank roll gigantic
School of hard knocks
I am the man on this campus
I'm like a quarterback, watch me hand it off

And my hair look I'm from Haiti
Haters sayin' I'm actin' funny
I'm on my baby, I'm about my cash money

And when you spiral through the atmosphere
All they see is motion
They never see the tears, they never feel the pain
They always think it's nothing
But it's something, such a shame
So caught up in the fantasy
Humanity has made a love story out of tragedy
But there is no romance in life that's on the ledge
And there's no one to talk you down
And tuck you in the bed
Lord, it's so ironic that it's funny
Of something for the books or the bars
To bob your head and nod
I recall, so many never ever thought you'd make it
So sad they were mistaken
The joy they tried to take it
Mama said that
"The best thing you can do and be is you
This world ain't got but one
So give credit where it is due"
Ain't that the truth
And here you are, a black unicorn
Mythical, mystical, since the day that you were born
Mastered all the madness
Let the magic have his way
Let the power paint the day
Let the god have his say
'Cause there's a place that you can go
No one else is allowed
Sitting up on your cloud
So high when you look down
Just glance upon the beauty and the wonder to be found
Then know that you can stop your search
'Cause love is all around
Yeah!
Free at last, free at last
That's what I said when I got out my last deal
Some people can't relate
Sleep is the cousin of death, that is some Nas shit
And when it's cold outside
So your pipes won't bust, turn on your faucet
Drip, fuck the water bill, we stay in apartments
And everything is a obstacle
When they watching you
The hospital needs a hospital
Now they mocking you
They say the flattery is sincere
I run like a nigga younger than me by ten years
Yeah, and that's my car talking
Old school running with the dogs barking
Hop out that bitch like I'm selling coffins
Weed so strong, I be seldom coughing
And I'm covered in Balmain
Instagram pics of my lobster omelette
Selling that Parkay, life ain't no arcade
Now I got more nines than the fourth grade
Alone, is all I really want
It's all I really want to be
It's all I really need
I want, I want and I believe
You thought you had the best of me
But now I'm what you need, you need, I feel you
Hear ye, hear ye, you can't come near me
Competition best to fear me
Lyrically I could be Talib Kweli
But with gold teeth it'd be hard for some to believe
I leave them pussies stinking
They need Summer's Eve
I practised repetition, I need 100 G's
100 M's, hug and squeeze
Dad kept us in the dungarees
I'm not a rat but I love the cheese
I change hoes like I change gears
And my yard so big I got pet deers
And my homies try to act like I ain't real
I put my apron on, I taught myself how to make meals
You need a focus group, my group focused
Hit them local jokers with the hocus pocus
I'm the dopest, you can quote this
Underscore, it's just me and Goat
Dirty ass niggas, we'll sell your ass a ki of soap
I done seen them rich, I done seen them broke
I done seen it all, watched a pregnant lady smoke
When the baby come out, he gon' be geeked
You never know, he might come out to be me

Ooh ooh ooh tomorrow, tomorrow (tomorrow, tomorrow)
Tomorrow, tomorrow (tomorrow, tomorrow) yea
Tomorrow, tomorrow (tomorrow, tomorrow) talkin' right now
Tomorrow, tomorrow (tomorrow, tomorrow) I'm talkin' right now

Put the rocket on that ma'fucka prosecutor
This Armani, this Givenchy, I parachute you
I'm so fly I jumped out the air wearing Gucci (tell 'em!)

Smoking California weed with California hoes (true!)

Money's the motivation, money's the conversation
You on vacation, we gettin' paid so
We on paycation, I did it for the fam'
It's whatever we had to do, it's just who I am
Yeah, it's the life I chose
Gunshots in the dark, one eye closed
And we got it cooking like a one-eyed stove
You can catch me kissing my girl with both eyes closed
Perfecting my passion, thanks for asking
Couldn't slow down so we had to crash it
You used plastic, we 'bout cash
I see some people ahead that we gon' pass yeah!
I never feared death or dying
I only fear never trying
I am whatever I am,
Only God can judge me now
One shot, everything rides on tonight
Even if I've got three strikes, I'ma go for it
This moment, we own it
And I'm not to be played with
Because it can get dangerous
See these people I ride with
This moment, we own it
And the same ones that I ride with,
Be the same ones that I die with
Put it all out on the line with,
If you looking for me you can find Wiz
In the new car or in the crown with
My new broad, that's a fine chick
And the wonder squad, I'm down with (And no way around it)
What you say, tell me what you say
Working hard, reppin' for my dogs, do this everyday,
Takin' off, looking out for all, makin' sure we ball,
Like the mob all you do is call
Catch you if you fall, Young Khalifa
I never feared death or dying
I only fear never trying
I am whatever I am,
Only God can judge me now
One shot, everything rides on tonight
Even if I've got three strikes, I'ma go for it
This moment, we own it
And I'm not to be played with
Because it can get dangerous
See these people I ride with
This moment, we own it
This the biggest day of my life
We got big guns, been graduated from knives
It's the day in the life and I'm ready to ride
Got the spirit, I'm feelin' like a killer inside uh
Financial outbreak, I'm free but I ain't out yet
Ridin' with the plug so I'm close to the outlet
At the red light, rims sittin' off set
I look better on your girl (Than her outfit)
Stuck to the plan, always think that we would stand up, never ran
We the fam' and loyalty never change up
Been down since day one, look at where we came from
Jumpin' out on anybody who try to say somethin' one thing about it
Got a problem, I got the same one
Money rolls, we fold
Plenty clubs we closed
Follow the same code
Never turn our backs, our cars don't even lose control
One shot, everything rides on tonight
Even if I've got three strikes, I'ma go for it
This moment, we own it
And I'm not to be played with
Because it can get dangerous
See these people I ride with
This moment, we own it
This moment we own it
I ride or die for mine
I'm ride or die material
One life to live so here we go
This moment we own it
Last night I bought the supermodel
Got head on the way home
She left her other friends at the club
Got home, and I fucked her with my J's on
And that's ratchet huh? Yeah
Her ass so big it look like she trying to walk backwards bruh

Take your bitch like I'm the dog catcher
Take your ass to the mall after
Spa day, shawty
Kill that pussy, pallbearer
You from that RuPaul era
I'm from that hell nah era
Real niggas say true
Real niggas ain't you
I ride around with that yapper on me
Gun clap when my Glock up on me
Surround your ass with so many shots
You'll be claustrophobic
Crib so big a dinosaur can run through that shit
I'm a shark, and you a tuna fish
My paper up, got your girl with her ankles up
Gangster boy
She got her T-shirt and her panties on
She trying to smell my cologne
I can fuck her anywhere I want
I even fuck her on the floor
And that's ratchet huh?
Her ass so big it look like she trying to walk backwards bruh

I'm on top like a toupÃƒÂ©e
You on the side like a toothache
Box your ass, suitcase
I'm real, you ain't
Calamari, crab cakes
My closet the size of your damn place
You lookin' at a star
I wish that they could add space
I'm getting money, fast pace
My hoes gave my cash straight
He can't ball, he castrated
She the opposite of last place
Do it, bust it open, slow it down, Robitussin
My girl got a big ass
Your girl, back pockets touching
I want a dollar, I want everything
Balls out, I let 'em hang
Window shopping for a wedding ring
On a double date with Molly and Mary Jane
And that's ratchet huh?
Her ass so big it look like she trying to walk backwards bruh
If you patch your weed that's ratchet
My last album was classic
Shawty on my dica
Backwards spells acid
She pop a P like a zany
She don't use no hands or no panties
She rock like nose candy
You fuck with me, ain't no plan B
I'm a D boy with a degree
I sold dope in my momma's home
My girl pussy deep (deep)
So right there is my comfort zone
Born alone, die alone
Mud in my Styrofoam
She got on top of me like a stage,
I said use my dick as a microphone
Girl I'm on that clean shit, you already know
You ain't never seen this, I'm ready to go

'Cause we always end up fucking every time I'm in town
Every time I'm in town (oh oh oh oh oh oh)
Every time I'm in town (oh oh oh oh oh oh)
Baby I just landed, you gon' pick me up
Heard you like to squirt, I might lick it up
Conspicuous, I speed it up
And I slow it down like I'm on Robitussin
I'm known for crushing, your known for blushing
Oh what was that
You blowing kisses, I throw 'em back, pull into that culdesac
Back then no chauffeur, back seat like a sofa
One leg on my shoulder, other leg and it's over
I know you love me
And I know you're down
'Cause we always end up fucking every time I'm in town
Every time I'm in town (oh oh oh oh oh oh)
Every time I'm in town (oh oh oh oh oh oh)
Met her once and you missed me, girl you crazy
With no makeup on, you're still pretty lady
And you beautiful, inside and outside
I don't know if I should buy my wife a house, or make you my house wife
You call me, I come through
You pass out, I come too
Dippin' it like fondue, spinach dip, cheese stick
Appetizers, entrees, it's you in that lingerie
As far as race, you's first place, I'm only on time for one day
I know you love me
And I know you're down
'Cause we always end up fucking every time I'm in town
Every time I'm in town (oh oh oh oh oh oh)
Every time I'm in town (oh oh oh oh oh oh)

I see you doing your thing, but it ain't nothing to me
So when you looking at me, I give you something to see
I say I'm incredible, most legible
Schedule ain't, but I can make your girl flexible, edible
Put her top and call it putting her on my pedestal
You would never know, unless you worked at the bank
Camel toe, look like steak
And your boy look like grate
2 gun bang
And I'm so fly I can sue an airplane
You can tell your girl here, because a cab came
And I keep it 100, I don't need no spare change
Some do it for the fame, some do it for the fortune
Fortunately I'm famous, 26's wheel of fortune
And I been riding foreign since the fucking introduction
I see you doing your thing, it ain't got nothing to me
So when you looking at me, I give you something to see
I see you doing your thing, it ain't got nothing to me
So when you looking at me, I give you something to see

Money machine, I need a money machine
I see you doing your thing, it ain't got nothing to me
So when you looking at me, I give you something to see
Yo it's my time to shine, so I'm checking my Rollie
A bet with the Lakers, I bought a necklace off Kobe
I be fucking your girl, I was texting her only
I told her, "I'd like your legs better if they was open"
Ever since the beginning, niggas knew I was focused
Strip club tour started Magic, ended at Strokers
I'm a fucking example of a fucking example
Hit her from the back, nigga, that's a fucking example
I came up on Luke Campbell, I'm so sick I need Campbells
If you know I'm showing up, I hope you come with your camera
Got the city on swole with my Louis bandana
My car is shitting on niggas, I should ride with a Pamper
I see you doing your thing, it ain't got nothing to me
So when you looking at me, I give you something to see
I see you doing your thing, it ain't got nothing to me
So when you looking at me, I give you something to see

Money machine, I need a money machine
I see you doing your thing, it ain't got nothing to me
So when you looking at me, I give you something to see
I give you something to see when you are looking this way
If you approach with the drama, then we approach with the K
And when you look in my eyes all you see is the pain
On medication, I can drink 200 a day
When you hot in the A, you get a spot in the A
It's so big that shit look like a spot in the A
These niggas jogging in place and they standing in line
Till somebody rhyme bout beating me, then they start dancing in line
And if swag was a crime, I'd be doing life plus 30
With my ice on early, in all gold notch sterling
Try to cook a brick off a George Foreman
Take a girl, it'll start spoiling
Living room floor look like a nigga going bowling
I see you doing your thing, it ain't got nothing to me
So when you looking at me, I give you something to see
I see you doing your thing, it ain't got nothing to me

I need a hustling trophy, it's my kind of grind
It's my time to get it, my time to shine
I need a hustling trophy, it's my kind of grind, bitch

I be playin with them racks like a kid,
Lean in baby bottles like a kid,
Ride on big whips like a kid,
like a kid, like a kid,
you turn up like a kid,
flexin like a kid,

I ain't playin with these niggas, pockets on big momma,
Pullin up on 6's, Gucci's cost six hunna,
Nothing in the whole wide can stop me (Ooh nothing can stop me)
Nothing in the whole wide world can stop me (Ooh loving you)
Nothing in the whole wide world can stop me (Nothing, nobody)
Can stop me from loving you
Foreign exchange, I walk in the rain, still won't get wet
Nigga flick up the flame, twist up the game, switch up the chain
Play peek-a-boo, I take ya girl and her friend and do a switch-a-roo
Started with a nick and got a 62, it was memorable my plan is worth diggable
Used to stashing work off in a inner tube
In middle school I worked the trap no interviews
Just told shawty that I'm in to you
I'm the type that make a old school a Bentley coupe
Turn one to ten that's what I tend to do
It's an amber alert I gotta missing roof
It was black and it was travelling fast I love you
Now I don't care about your ratchet past
Designer shoes, matching bags
Let them niggas pop shit baby we popping tags
If I ever fall off I'll be hopping back
Got a bad bitch with me, told her hop in back
My car speak, she dark meat
I be eating MC's, nigga shark teeth
Velour hoodie I ask 'em what's for goody
If you are what you eat but I am not a pussy
You couldn't stop me with a bunch of Uzi's
And all we really do is shoot a bunch of movies

Started from the bottom now we at the top
Graduated from high school and bought a choppa
Orville Redenbacher bitch we got it poppin'
On the block with that white girl, Cindy Lauper
When they saw me they used to think of dope
But now when they see me they just think of hope
Inspiration, no infiltration
Them niggas hatin', I got they bitches naked
Hand full of ones pocket full of Hunn
If I was sellin' swag man I woulda sold a ton
Designer sneaks leather seats
They say money talk that's why you never speak
Every verse I do is a rest in peace
Wish this highway to heaven had an extra seat
Rap game extra sweet, big ass charm conversation piece
Million off rap but the trap was sweeter
When dealings on the block all prices cheaper
I been doing this since guess and fila
They say my entourage each car four deep eight heaters
Drop the middle man to cut the cost
They say my whole click cut from a different cloth
And of course we pay the cost with each block
That we off ya take off and call back
It ain't our fault that ya lost ya lil bitch
Ask ya boy bout them forty he lost talk slick
Glock forty ya boss now you the president
Fresher than peppermint whip tint
Till six bond number nine flow wall street bidness bitch

Nothing in the whole wide can stop me (Ooh nothing can stop me)
Nothing in the whole wide world can stop me (Ooh loving you)
Nothing in the whole wide world can stop me (Nothing, nobody)
Can stop me from loving you


The night is young (the night is young)
Come and go with me (come and go with me)
Up in the sky (up in the sky)
Is where you wanna be.
Don't bring me down, don't bring me down
Don't bring me down, don't bring me down
Don't bring me down, don't bring me down
Tonight I'm twistin' 'em big, I'm poppin' pink bottles
Pull out the old school chevys and make the pipes rattle
Kev wrap the rubber bands, no credit cards
45 catch the cliques, no bodyguards
Call that my real nigga passport
Pull 'em out when them old bitches ask for it
I've been collecting paper, tryna stuff my bank account
With this pen and paper give you somethin' to think about
The diamonds shine and the wine is muscato
We ride shit from my garage, fuck a limo
My piece is 1 tenth of a dollar
She left her panties at my crib on the coffee table
I'm waitin' for the beat
The night is young (the night is young)
Come and go with me (come and go with me)
Up in the sky (up in the sky)
Is where you wanna be.
Don't bring me down, don't bring me down
Don't bring me down, don't bring me down
Don't bring me down, don't bring me down
Tonight we're takin' the city and paintin' it all black
Drama on the soundtrack and it's all crack
Your speed exceed 100 down i20
We breathe and smoke in and out and got plenty
I'm on the passenger, tonight I'm lettin' my bitch drive
She here to buckle and the car commitin' suicide
Law enforcement on my car with cameras
Tryna connect gang members and gangsta rappers
Drug dealers, athletes and black actors
Get caught up, prostitutes and back taxes
Fuck it, tonight we're livin' like we don't exist
Time stopped like I broke the watch on my wrist
Somewhere you wanna be?
The night is young (the night is young)
Come and go with me (come and go with me)
Up in the sky (up in the sky)
Is where you wanna be.
Don't bring me down, don't bring me down
Don't bring me down, don't bring me down
Don't bring me down, don't bring me down
What goes up must come down
And if I stay down, then I don't come up
Life a bitch, I got my hand on the but, foot on the clutch
On my new wonder, smokin' a blunt.
Tired of all sililaquez, service squeeze
Still use a triple b for insominity
And please, if bein' broke is your disease
I took a test and passed and nigga I'm clean.
Promethazine poured in the 2 liter
Got my gorillas with me, and I'm the zookeeper
See, you ain't seen it all until you've seen it all
If life a movie you never know when it might pause.
The night is young (the night is young)
Come and go with me (come and go with me)
Up in the sky (up in the sky)
Is where you wanna be.
Don't bring me down, don't bring me down
Don't bring me down, don't bring me down
Don't bring me down, don't bring me down

'Cuz I went from views from my moms house to views
of the ocean. N-gg-s talk s-it but that's free promotion.
I'm livin' my life like the end is approachin'
Man f-ck these n-gg-s wit a passion. I'm gettin' paid from
the cradle to the casket. My grandma said, "Boy you needa
read a Bible chapter". 'Til I brought her a-s a house bigger
then the Pastor's "Halla-Lew-Yer". Your now f-ckin' wit a bad

Put it on, give her a kiss, and tell her, "Do better"
She said, "How 'bout I get you jewelry from the Weston?"
How 'bout she hit the 'West Inn' and get her best friend?
I'm jokin', I'm just serious, I asked her
Don't be actin' like no actress, if we preachin' then we practice
Don't be reachin', don't be touchin' shit

Pull up to the scene with my ceiling missing
2 Chainz got your girl on the celly
And when I get off the celly

When she meet at the telly

When it go in her belly, it ain't shit you can tell me
Hair long, money long
Me and broke niggas we don't get along
Hair long, money long
Me and broke niggas we don't get along
I paid a thousand dollars for my sneakers
Ye told ya, a hundred k for a feature
Ee-er Ee-er, sound of the bed
Beat it up, beat it up, then I get some head
Well I might get some head, then I beat it up
I don't give a fuck, switch it up, nigga live it up
Yeah it's going down, so get up
Might valet park a Brinks truck

Let's play big bank, take little bank
You are looking at a shark in a fish tank
When I'm in the kitchen, I make plenty cash
Tell shawty come here, she got plenty a**

Yeah, I love them strippers (x4)
In my foreign car, got the trunk by the engine
So when I back back, I'm fronting on you niggas


First I back back, Louie back pack
Where's Paris Hilton? Where's Kat Stacks?
I'm round four with this ammunition
My camo come from Tru Religion
Them broke hoes can't pay attention
Your cutie missing, New Edition
Mr. Telephone Man, there's something wrong with my line
When I call my baby's number, I get a click every time
Every line is dope, you can snort it
Working in the pot, I can make you do aerobics
I'm haterphobic, they mad cause I'm winning
They busy high and catching, mad cause I'm pinching!
All my bitches different, all my diamonds glistening!
My weed so loud, everybody listen!
They say it's for the birds, so I bought a kilo!
My Boost Mobile chirping, it must be my amigo!
Chorus

Man I wish a bitch would, hundred-thousand dollar engine, I wish a bitch could

Yuck Daddy! Yuck!
Yuck Daddy! Yuck!
Uh, cut the top off, call it Amber Rose
Just bought a big body, time to paint the toes
Known to act a donkey on the camel-toe
Then take the camel-toe and turn it into casserole
2 Chainz talkin' on the flex phone
Poof! Just like that the whole check gone
Former posturepedic I was slept on
So many chains on it look like my neck gone
My girl came through and brought an extra body
Now that's an after party for the after party
Two-gun game, all-black Ferrari
His and her Armani, put it in a tonic
And yeah, the bread good if the head good
Before Benihana's it was canned goods
Before canned goods it was Similac
I'm from where they send shots then we send 'em back
A half a million dollars worth of crack money
Wrap your parents up, now you got a black mommy
Yeah I did it, true to my religion
Two guns on me, both with extensions
If you on the pole, play your position
I got enough dough to pay your tuition
Corduroy Trues, with the skull cap
I just woke up, tell me where the drugs at
And after the drugs, where the girls at
And after the girls, where the love at
And if it ain't no love, I'm like fuck that
Nigga I'm so dope, you could catch a fuckin' contact
Good weed, bad bitch
Got these hoes on my dick like Brad Pitt
Whoa, I seen it all before
The bitch got a man, but she schemin' on the low
How it go? It go, fuck them other niggas cause I'm down for my niggas
My homies got the blickers, automatics no clickers
Huh? Codine, no liquor
Man, life is a bitch, mine is a gold digger
I'm fucked, let's fuck
She said she on her period, I said, "Yuck"
I called another bopper, I beat it like a copper
Two big chain, one big chopper, bitch
I got the chopper for the cold response
The codine got me standin' horizontal
I had enough of the broken promises
So I'm in a room full of Pocahontas's
And this shit is off the meat rack
Weed sack, big car, layin' with my seat back
We next, weed never left Holland, weed bag
All this ice on my and my niggas playing freeze tag
Lord forgive me, this my fourth foreign
If you baby daddy lame, you should forewarn him
I come through with the yapper on
Turn that nigga into hot bologna
I'm the type a nigga cop a Rolly, cop a Benz, cop a two
Then wear it all to Church, nigga Hallelu
Uh, I'm from the trap where the block'll pay you
Me and my nigga pass your ho like a hot potato
I be like you could get her, he be like you could get her
I be like you could have her, he be like you could have her
He be like, it don't matter, I be like, me neither

Good weed, bad bitch

You go downstairs and fall asleep with the T.V. on
Y'all been together ten years, you deserve a mÃƒÂ©nage
'Specially if you put that BMW in her garage
'Specially if you paid a couple payments on her mamma crib
Went to her niece's graduation, man, I hate those kids
Last birthday, she got you a new sweater
Put it on, give her a kiss, and tell her, "Do better"
She said, "How 'bout I get you jewelry from the Weston?"
How 'bout she hit the 'West Inn' and get her best friend?
I'm jokin', I'm just serious, I asked her
Don't be actin' like no actress, if we preachin' then we practice
Don't be reachin', don't be touchin' shit

My ghetto dreams always turn to ghetto nightmares
At night I can't sleep, I toss and turn
Candlesticks in the dark, I was whippin' the hard
I was gettin' the broads that like "who the hell is that"
I was dealing sacks, you looking at niggas that drove to hell and back.
Charismatic I was raised by a addict with money in the attic.
Got goons while you at it at
This present time I'm out of my mind and that's a habit,
Still got them waiting in line they gotta have
Last night was the first night I got sleep
Tossing and turning for two or three weeks
My nightmares are triggered by bad memories
Lord, send me an angel right now while I'm having ghetto dreams
Cold sweats listenin' to the old sweat
One, two that's a ho check
Now for real, nigga this a whole check
Just bossin' around, polo sweats
Used to dream 'bout a bigger couch
Woke up in a bigger house, come on
Commas in my bank account
So much money I had to let the banker count
Last night was the first night I got sleep
Tossing and turning for two or three weeks
My nightmares are triggered by bad memories
Lord, send me an angel right now while I'm having ghetto dreams
It's like the world stand still
Yesterday your little man got killed
And all he ever wanted was a bank roll
But he died too young 'cause the game's cold
Most niggas ain't know, or they just think slow
Once you get in you gotta leave but you can't though
Does freedom make a motherfucker evil
To the point down your ass when he see you
Let's take that needle, fill it with poison
Inject the ghetto with the drug, paranoia
Got you lookin' at your homeboy sideways
Ain't no honor among thieves is there nowadays
They tell me crime pays, but I don't think so
Because every criminal I know is in the clink, yo
A nigga in the game right now
Must be working for them people cause that shit played out
I lay awake in my four corner room with the candles
Drumma boy, oh yeah, oh yeah boy
Warrup drum? Oh yeah, you feel me?
Oh, thats what we doin man
Doing up on a lot of people
2 chaaaaiiinnnzz
One thing I know,
These niggas cannot do it like me
2 chaaaaiiinnnzz
 x 2
Cant do it like me, cant do it like me
Cant do it like me, cant do it like me
Cant do it like me, cant what
Cant do it like me, like me, like me,
Cant do it like me, like me, like me, oh yeah
Cant do it like me, like me, like me, oh yeah
Most these niggas try but they cant do it
Thats unlikely
Know this when you see the work
You know that is unlikely
A replicated imitation, you cant beat me slightly
You know soon as you hear the track
No question mark or might be
Im bishop they buy me, Im off the hook, off the hook
Got these niggas in check mate, off the rook, off the rook
Bitch Im bout the turnt up, let them lamers burn up
Niggas aint got my work ethic I'm Hustling till the sun up
Continue to set the standards, rearrange the plans
Ever since Ive been in, Ive been stacking them bands
From a off, like firecrackers, Im too hot to tame
For the e way, Im rolling out, just stay out of my lane
When I slow down they say speed up
When I speed up they say slow it down
Im money bound
Im so high, I can eat a cloud
Mister child
Yacht club like Thurston Howell,
your girl is so thirsty now
Her man's swag like Gomer Pile
Click pow! every verse is a murder trial
Versatile, style on top of style on top of style yeah
When I say I hop the I stand for islands
When I fly, no items, when I land, I buy them
New clothes, your hoes, aint shit, Ill but them
Dollar signs my eyes lids, now I see the bigger picture
HD, flat screens, tv same size as Paul Pierce
And aint no comparing us, man we do it major
And if they aint talking bout shit
Tell them eat some toilet paper, ugh!

Let's play big bank take little bank
You are looking at a shark in a fish tank
When I'm in the kitchen, I make plenty cash
Tell shawty come here, she got plenty ass

Tell Tyga, lookin' for this bitch called Blac Chyna
Take a nigga bitch in a hot flash, menopause hot flash
Yes that's why I'm crowned queen, and I ain't lookin' for the prom king
These hoes' careers ain't promising, killing these bitches, crime scene
Ooh that's how a bitch do it
Fifty black trucks gonna follow when I pull up
Dick shit hit you in the chin like a pull up
My door so cocky, my door so stuck up

Live up in this piece
I'ma set off like this, check me out
Now who's these crazy niggaz, drinkin
crazy, pussy, out of crazy straw
Thinkin they crazy hardcore, crazy metaphor
Matter of fact I think them niggaz is gay
Always having a party with no DJ

When I rap competition be like "What Squad be on it like that?"
Man, pssct, fuck that
We stay with the lethal dosage
Click on the mic MC's run like roaches
Now they got me up in England my jewels be dangling
While my single be singling
I come with the hardcore
Redman please come off the wall with some more

Yes y'all I come down with the ruckus
Don't y'all know I be the nigga jammin y'all like Smuckers
Freeze, come consecutively like EPMD LP's
Robbin y'all for cheese, now yes y'all whaddIdo
Fuck you and you drink the Olde E brew
Down with Funkmaster Flex yes who's next
To get they whole set burnt like Waco, Tex
Now, I comes down with the sound
Def Squad represent, yes we extra swift
We comes with the boogie, fuck all you rookies
We some tough cookies on the mic dynamite

We here to make a dollar out of fifteen cents
And let our balls hang like we on the toilet takin a shit
Styles is all that, and a big bag of chips with the dip
So fuck all that sensuous shit
I represent intellectual violence
And leave your click holier than the ten commandments
Like Redman I shift with the Ruck
If your if was a spliff we'd be ALL fucked up
No need to ask who is he so we get busy
Scuff our Tims on the boulevard of MANY rough cities
I'll have to Norman Bate ya I love to hate ya
Cuz youse a freak by nate
Can't make the face ya brain erasure
Drink your lyrics down straight with no chaser
My verbal combat's like a mini-Mac to your back
As soon as one of you niggaz try to overreact
The L.O.D. love good confrontation of amp
Break your motivation murder your camp
For the jealous, overzealous, we top sellers fellas
Blow the spot like Branford Marsalis
Niggaz comin through and acting wild
Redman smack the smile off that kid
I am smoking on that gas, life should be on Cinemax
Movie, Bought my boo bigger tits and a bigger ass
Who he's, not I, I smoke strong, that Popeye
Louie V's in my archives, black diamonds, apartheid
Bread up and my top down
On the block with a block out
Hit ya ass with that block out
Dope enough to go in yo nostrils
I take ya girl and kidnap her
Beat her to my mattress
A skeleton in my closet
It's probably one of these dead ass rappers
It's probably one of these pussy ass niggas
Don't try me I pull that trigga
Got ya car note in my car
And your rent in my swisha
That pussy so good I miss ya
Head game's so vicious
And all I get is cheese
Like I'm taking pictures

You want true, that's true enough
Forbes list like every year
My office is my tour bus
She came through, she brought food
She got fucked, she knew wassup
She think I'm the realest out
And I say "damn, that makes two of us"
Aww that look like what's her name
Chances are it's what's her name
Chances are, if she was acting up
Then I fucked her once and never fucked again
She could have a Grammy, I still treat her ass like a nominee
Just need to know what that pussy like so one time it's fine with me
Young ass an intern, with money like I built the shit
Streets talking that confirm
Go ask them who just catch it
Stay keeping my cup full so I'm extra charged like a state tax
Me and Chainz go way back
We don't talk shit, we just say facts (Just know it)
I say fuck you, 'less I'm wit' ya
If I take you out of the picture

Name a nigga that want some

Put his ass in a plastic bag with his trash ass
Take 'em out, bring 'em in

Thug Life, one wife, a mistress and a girlfriend

Went where they say I couldn't (true)
YSL belt buckle
Y'all niggas sure is looking

Fuck more hoes than advertise
They say Tune you're dead wrong
I say wrong, had to die
Pussy nigga don't keep it real no more
Drug dealers changed but the high stay the same
Prices go up but the high stay the same
Gotta watch for undercovers like crying in the rain
Chillin' in the crib with the lock on the door
Layin' on the couch with the Glock on the floor
Within arm reach, security, alarm breach
I just cut off the lights so I don't shoot my hoe
I eat so much shrimp, I smoke so much hemp
The world too small, it feel like 4 walls
You see I got holes punched in
My chances are cold cut thin, but I still took 'em and nigga we made it
T roll that killer, weed up in the Swisher, and make it as fat as a pig in a blanket
My BFF is Benjamin Franklin, they cry for help we get 'em a hanky
Ain't nothing sweet but the shit that we drinkin', the bitches we bangin', the cinnamon danish
The pen is paining, shit is restraining
It is a shame but niggas is shameless
Niggas is assholes, or enemas, finna get anal
Injury, time out, I just blew my mind out
But still I'm maintaining
Real gangsta shit it get dangerous
You talking money and guns, 2 languages
I throw niggas from off of the plane I'm in

What you do it for if it ain't for this
I watch my step so much, I'm starting to feel like my ankles' wrist
Cold hearted, starting to feel like I'm in Anchorage when I think of this
And rude awakenings get taken in like fragrances
Bitch I smell like money, dope and cologne
I say bitch I smell like money, that's that dope and cologne
And if he ain't getting money, don't love him, leave his broke ass alone
I say if he ain't getting money, leave his stank ass alone
'Cause bitch I smell like money, I smell like money
When you this rich they call it wealthy
Shit they gotta call it somethin'
Lord I done got too rich for stuntin' (Damn)
But not for thuggin.'
That's right bitch I smell like money, money
You smell me coming

Totin' double barrels in a horse and carriage
Ain't scared of nothing except God and marriage
Through the concrete grew a rose petal
If trapping was a sport, I'd have a gold medal
I steal her like Jerome Bettis
Call me Trill Cosby, I might spike my own beverage
Parallel park in front of Neiman Marcus
He ain't never fly nigga, like an ostrich
They say ain't nothing for free, but please free my partnas
Might have a swag contest and give out free Versaces
Yea, lobster rolls for an appetizer
Bad red bitch give me a lap-etizer
I'm in my Rolls Royce because it's black and wiser
And don't get in the way, my nig this rapid fire

Codeines, Xanax and liquor
Prescriptions and couple pistols
Got clean molly with the crystals
Middle finger to the judicials
Fork and a pot is my utensils
Had a threesome with 2 sisters
I get head and you kiss her
I don't never call and you miss her
I got every gun except a missile
I paid attention to the minister
My silhouette is sinister
Only child with trust issues
You couldn't walk a mile in my hoop shoes
Me and Tune 2 loose screws
2 parts in my box cut, my pop wouldn't even pop up
Last night I prayed to God and asked for him to make a drop truck
Polo tee and ice watch, moccasins without socks
And I smell like money, I can count a hundred thousand with the lights off
I say bitch I smell like money, that's that dope and cologne
And if he ain't getting money, don't love him, leave his broke ass alone
I say if he ain't getting money, leave his stank ass alone
'Cause bitch I smell like money

Put gold on the white coupe
Put gold on the white tooth
Put gold on my wife too
3 chainz, owww
Caught up in my bullshit, put your head on backwards
And skate off after, engage in laughter 'bout what just happened
Fingers and napkins get sent to mammies, is that too graphic?
Catch you in traffic, you sitting daffy like stealing candy
My ceiling's absent, my wheels are massive, my friends assassins
All of us bastards, our mothers queens and our women dancers
My rivers rapid, my fins are splashin', my gills are flappin'
I bend some matches, then sip some gas and went kissed a dragon
I'm really rappin', I'm finger snappin', I'm pistol packin'
Y'all niggas slippin', my swag is drippin', so here's a napkin
What's really happnin' bro?
Verbal attackin', I'm showing passion
Know what I mean, see I'm the king like I'm from Akron
I'm going overboard, somebody call the captain
And when it come to getting checks, I always want the fat ones
I'm so high I can sing to a chandelier
My flow a glass of Ace of Spade and yours a can of beer
Too many bitches, too many blunts, too many buttons
Not enough bullets, them niggas buggin', the squad is comin'
AK on shoulder, no shoulder shruggin', aim at your nugget
My weed sticky like acupuncture and Magnus honey
Knock on the side door three times and have your money
Or get to steppin' like Kappas stompin', I'll slap a junkie
I'm having lunch with Italian Sonny, don't ask the subject
Lord why you took Rabbit from me, he say don't ask me nothing
Too many bodies, too many bangers, too many bundles
Not enough bullets, these niggas buggin', I heard they stung you
It's gon' be trouble, we come through and catch you while you cuddle
Them shotgun barrels like tunnels nigga, don't even mumble
I'm back to ballin', I'm in the back full of Magnums only
Pull on the scene and I fuck your queen playing Pastor Troy
Our weed ready, turkey spaghetti and Castrol oil
That's codeine turn your guillotine to a fashion show
In 4 minutes I'll turn this into forensics in a foreign car with a foreign broad
That's long winded, paper long, and you taking long, you just don't get it
Hung the phone up and Satan, told me want a song with me
Hotter than Mississippi, the summer of 1950s
In a van full of some niggas and white bitches
Get pulled over for swervin' like "Hi, officer,"
When he ask me why I was swerving, "I'm high, officer."

I bang your madam, she get on top and I shake the ladder
I make her straddle then gather and calculate the data
I listen up for the snakes or the baby rattle
I play the shadows, don't play no games, I straight get at 'em
I'm on the chronic all day like it's my favorite album
A plate of salmon, the Cayman Islands, a stripper dancer
If I don't get the car first, I'll have a temper tantrum
I'm innovative, I demonstrated, this nigga played it
I don't care if you owe me a nick, nigga you need to pay me
I kiss ya lady, eat her pussy, then kiss the baby
Get situated, get keys off table, then leave her 80
I really made it, get it maid, Schwarzenegger
Won't wrestle niggas, I spatula all you action figures
I'm so high the blunt feel like a dumbbell
These niggas tiny like a spider on a Spud Webb
I got some upscale cocaine on my thumbnail
I feed it to my fun girls, they say fuck yeah
I'm doing this shit like whatever
When I go I'mma leave for the better
I told her you dig like a shovel
I want a Ferrari in yellow
Just so I can match all my yellow bitches
I been a playa since elementary
I got more bars than a penitentiary
I got a clip that hang several inches
I can make it bounce by myself

Really don't wanna see me work, son - pull back the curtain, woo

Hangin' wit' the killers and I'm feelin' presidential
Big brother went and got the fuckin' drop head
Now I make a old bitch drop head, I'll make yo' bitch drop head
Put the pedal to the floor, now her panties on the floor
Nigga, I'll make yo' bitch drop that!
I smoke the most of the reefer, hangin' wit' Dos Cadenas
Made it rain, hurricane, give out that money like FEMA
Turn that lil bitch to Katrina, fuck up the money from features
Watch how a thug get a Beamer all from rappin' and singin'


We need 8 in these streets like a straight out
Coupe wit' the roof you could take off, crew finna take off
Killin' these hoes if I pull up wit' tech
Cause the [?] will save y'all
, wanted to play ball
Got addicted to watchin' that lean drip

When the defence really on, ain't no test
Pull up real slow in a taxi
Gunshots turn 'em into athletes
I was hungry for a mil I got a half
Drove a couple couple cars up the mansion (Nah foreal at one time)
Smoked a whole seven sitting in the traffic
And niggas couldn't beat me if they practised
Used to use my safe for a mattress
Used to use my mattress for a safe
See I could count a hundred thousand backwards (99, 98, 97)
And I'm just tryna get it every day
They feigning for the trappers and the rappers

Old school with the rallies
Used to meet them up at rallies

Shawty want to hit me in the head like a boxer
Niggas ain't real, they imposters

But I'm flexin' on my baby mama
I'm like, "Damn I shoulda worn a condom."
Boom boom boom
My shoes sold out in one day
Pull out the blueprint bumpin' dat Gunplay
In a Maybach pockets stay fat
So fly I could parallel park on a fucking runway
Going down a one way the wrong way
Shoot barrel long range
Swag like pro ball
Gave her a ring, phone call
Money talk, pole vault
Walked in, drove off
So uncomfortable at the dealership, I don't take my robe off
I wake up and I get to it
Breakfast time I might sea food it
Lunch time I might lamb chop it
And you do is talk shit like you was eatin' booty
Southside in my bloodstream
Smokin' on that propane
I could tell ya ass one thing, I like gettin' head wearing both chains
All white with no stains
I been trappin' fore the Grammy nods
I been countin' money so long
I'mma need a damn hand massage
So many cars
I can barely park
So many cars
I need another damn garage
I'm famous with my fam around
Damn I wish I had my dad around
Gave a nigga a Lamborghini
So that's a motherfuckin' lamb-me-down
Watch how I'mma kill 'em for the summer (Watch how I'ma kill em)
Watch how I'mma kill em for the summer (Watch how I'ma kill em)
I'm just flexin' on my baby mama (I'm just flexin')
I'm just flexin' on my baby mama (I'm just flexin')
Watch how I'mma kill 'em for the summer (Watch how I'ma kill em)
Watch how I'mma kill em for the summer (Watch how I'ma kill em)

Ey, European style my dresscode
Gunshots in the club, echo
Walk around with a .36
With six shots in my .38 Special
Black car, black Timbs
Bank of America back then
She tryna tell me her life story
And all I want is a lap dance
Good times smokin' J's rockin' J's in the rap Ernie Barnes
If I paint a canvas it'd be Melee
Firearms, Viacom, maricÃƒÂ³n
If she bad I invite her home
Buying chains like I'm buyin' homes
Rims taller than Kevin Hart, Ride Along
Them rhinestones you ain't shinin' nigga
I ain't hidin' so you ain't gotta find me nigga
All my clothes are designer nigga
In my back seat reclinin' nigga
Came in rockin' all gold
And I'm fuckin' all y'all hoes
Smokin' on that Lee Haney
Sippin' on that hard boiled

Click clack get back
Smokin' on raw paper
This ain't zig zags
Snakeskin wallpaper
Rose gold chandelier
I'm lookin' for a baby eater
Can I get a volunteer?
Watch how I'mma kill 'em for the summer (Watch how I'ma kill em)
Watch how I'mma kill em for the summer (Watch how I'ma kill em)
I'm just flexin' on my baby mama (I'm just flexin')

Watch how I'mma kill 'em for the summer (Watch how I'ma kill em)
Watch how I'mma kill em for the summer (Watch how I'ma kill em)
I'm just flexin' on my baby mama (I'm just flexin')
I said I'm just flexin' on my baby mama (I'm just flexin')
I said I take care of my kids
But I'm flexin' on my baby mama
I'm like "Damn I shoulda worn a condom"
