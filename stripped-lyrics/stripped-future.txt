 Dirty soda, Spike Lee, white girl, iced tea
Fully loaded AP, yeah
I just fucked your bitch in some Gucci flip flops
I just had some bitches and I made them lip lock
I just took a piss and I seen codeine coming out
We got purple Activis, I thought it was a drought
Bitch I'ma choose the dirty over you
You know I ain't scared to lose you
They don't like it when you're telling the truth
I'd rather be realer than you
I had to make me a cup now
I called a contractor to make me a Sprite
I sold the dope out your house
Now you come to my house, I've got dope in the couch
You know I don't fuck with no rumors
Rocking red bottoms like they Pumas
Have these bands on me, I'mma do 'em
I take these pills and I'm having a thrill
Taking prescription's a hell of a feeling
As for the xanny, I never forgot it
Got 'em begging to call up my phone tryna have a menage
Got a porter, the cash can't even stay in the house cause there's too much to hide
Whip the four to a nine, gotta pay up the rent I was too far behind
Fuck 'em two at a time, fuck 'em two at a time
Had to do what I had to do to get where I'm at
Niggas, no, I ain't lying, niggas, no, I ain't lying
There's a lot on my mind, there's a lot on my plate
But I never complain
I was working the weight like I came out the gym, I never did train
Put the girl on a train
Strapped a bird on her back, now she came back with change, ay
I just fucked your bitch in some Gucci flip flops
I just had some bitches and I made them lip lock
I just took a piss and I seen codeine coming out
We got purple Activis, I thought it was a drought
I just fucked your bitch in some Gucci flip flops
I just had some bitches and I made them lip lock
I just took a piss and I seen codeine coming out
We got purple Activis, I thought it was a drought
I strapped the dope to your spouse
The first time I gave her an ounce
I put some free bands in her account
I told her "bitch, can't be running your mouth
Better watch what you say to these niggas
Cause you already know what they 'bout"
Put the game in a choke in a knot
Hit that bitch while I'm choking her out
Put the hook on her, now she got love in the south
I got some purp on me now
Stacking the styrofoams up by the door
They don't let me back in, they ain't know they in trouble
Valet the whip by the front door
On a percocet now and I need me some more
Tell me them lies that you want me to hear
I try to forget but it's hard to forgive
Take me some codeine and pop me a pill
I pull on a blunt and blow smoke out my ears
I smoke on this blunt, I get high as I can
I float off the Earth in designer
I'm working on having some manners
I'm thinking about it right now
I'm holding the cash while I pour up the lean
Then I put one in the air
I just fucked your bitch in some Gucci flip flops
I just had some bitches and I made them lip lock
I just took a piss and I seen codeine coming out
We got purple Activis, I thought it was a drought
I just fucked your bitch in some Gucci flip flops
I just had some bitches and I made them lip lock
I just took a piss and I seen codeine coming out
We got purple Activis, I thought it was a drought
Thought it was a drought, thought it, thought it was a drought
We thought it was a drought, we poured a Activis
Bitch I'ma choose the dirty over you
You know I ain't scared to lose you
They don't like it when you're telling the truth
I'd rather be realer than you

Right shoot on mad dick, like I m from nyc
I m counting for sunglasses, I see my shit in 3d
I m popping bottles nigga, like its the 4th of july
I think I m Bill Gates, I m taking over the net
We shoot them choppas nigga, we don t fuck with the tekx
I think I m young g, cause I motivate thugs
Yeah, I think I lil boosy, I m bout to start something hit
Hey future cause ...i m on that mafia shit
After I smash her, I don t care who call next
I take off in the bentley, and came back in the spot
My chop on steroids, we swerving Mark Mcquire
Who you thank you is, who you thank you is?
Who you thank you is, who you thank you is?
Who you thank you is, who you thank you is?
I know my dough raw, I see in it come out her ass
I wipe that shit off, and throw it right in the back
Homie, the felony, this shit I do in dream
Future, yeah arrogant, now think I m the king
Name a bitch I can t fuck, name a bitch I didn t take
Name a bitch ... just I ain t want, I ain t want
Gonna go atoine jameson, I m balling, balling, balling
Hit them ... and I ride round with that burner
I keep them young gunners, and they gonn squeeze on anything
I think I m ... I think I m... I think I m ...
A sack fucll of hunneds, all this ice on me
I turn on vvs eses and snapped her right on my chain
After I smash her, I don t care who call next
I take off in the bentley, and came back in the spot
My chop on steroids, we swerving Mark Mcquire
Who you thank you is, who you thank you is?
Who you thank you is, who you thank you is?
Who you thank you is, who you thank you is?
Never thought I'd be talking from this perspective
But I'm not really sure what else you expected
When the higher-ups have all come together as a collective
With conspiracies to end my run and send me a message
40, Did you get the message?
Cause I just checked my phone and I didn't get it
I mean, I say hats off for a solid effort
But we didn't flinch for a second, we got our shit together
Yeah, not here to fight wars
But niggas wanna talk high scores
Party just dipped off in a white Porsche
And I just came from dinner where I ate some well done seared scallops
That were to die for
But I got bigger fish to fry
I'm talking bigger shit than you and I
Kids'll lose their lives, got me scared of losing mine
And if I hold my tongue about it, I get crucified
Wrote this shit on a bumpy flight on a summer night
Flying over Chattanooga, out here trying to spread the movement
I just got me the Mercedes Pullman
You niggas never heard of it, you gotta hit up Google
Back in the city, shit is getting brutal
These kids'll hit your noodle then take a girl to the movies
They've been dropping out on both sides
We ain't in it, we just ghost ride
The pen is working if you niggas need some ghost lines
I thought you wanted yours like I want mine
I guess you just making moves on your own time
But just know it'll be January in no time
And your absence is very concerning
It's like you went on vacation with no plan of returning
Shit is purely for sport, I need it 30 for 30
Banners are ready in case we need to retire your jersey
I got a club in the Raptors arena
Championships, celebrations during regular seasons
Paternity testing for women that I never slept with
I'm legally obligated if they request it
So much legal action like I'm Michael Jackson
Luckily, I'm great at avoiding distraction
Used to get no reaction, now I'm overreacting
Ah nigga, that shit gotta go platinum
I just listened to Closer To My Dreams
Wide eyed and uneducated at 19
I can't rap like that, all young and naive
Not after all of the shit I've seen and the things I believe
Drastically changing, thank you for all your patience
I'm just in a different space and I choose to embrace it
4,000 Square feet just isn't as spacious
You loved me back in the basement, guess it is what we make it
I'm tired of awkward exchanges and nigga's crooked ways
Tired of champagne toasts with people that look away
Peyton and Eli when niggas called me they brother the season start
And I don't wanna see you end up with nothing
Y'all throw the word "family" around too much in discussion
Rookie season, I would've never thought this was coming
They knees give out and they passing to you all of a sudden
Now you the one getting buckets
They put their arm around you, now you becoming the crutches
Kids got on your number cause you the one they look up to
And women that you seen on TV look better in person
And either they wanna fuck you or convince you
That they can to see where it goes from there
But these ain't the girls from Brampton, this ain't that local action
The haters just bringing me and my people closer, actually
What happened to the things you niggas said was supposed to happen?
Are we just supposed to ignore the fact that it never happened?
We just supposed to get the pie and then split it in two?
Supposed to forget your mistakes but not forget about you?
My plan was always to make the product jump off the shelf
And treat the money like secrets, keep that shit to ourselves
Papi champÃƒÂº, young pablito de seis dios
6 G-O-D, I think I was destined for this shit when I was 'round Keyshia Cole and T.I
And Young Dro was popping off, well ain't I?

And if a nigga say my name, he the hot shit
But if I say the nigga name, he still the hot shit
Fucked up, lucky I don't feed into the gossip
Niggas act like they don't know, but they should know

I know y'all already know Mike Will Made It
Just looking at the numbers, nigga, I feel amazing
I call Michael Jordan up and Mike will make it
I'm the young rap nigga with the 'Melo deal

Nigga you ain't fuckin' with a picture of me
I got all this cake and shooters with me
Just in case you pussy niggas try to get you a piece
What it is my nigga, what is hidden for
Where the car you were whippin in the video
Where is the ice at, where is them pretty hoes
You are far from a real nigga, you already know
Broke ass niggas I can't stand them
I hit 'em with the cannon
I buying out the mall at random
Juicy J that nigga is fresh to death
Smoke till there is nothing left
Bail off and then I'm ghost in my Phantom

Ooh went away (DJ Drama) (Mike Will Made It)
When the sun dies
And the stars fade from view
Our love will remain real and true
Through the distant
And cold depths of space
The radio sings our song
It's a love real and true
Hold on, hold on, hold up Future, what the fuck you doin'?
You can annihilate way more chicks than the chick you screwin'
You on top of your game, homie, man you a star
You got real bitches, they love that nigga that you are
They say you're like Jimi Hendrix, in his early twenties
You in Vegas, you supposed to be with a snow bunny
You a player, huh, you wanna come around and save her
Keep it trill, you lovin' her just as much as your career
You mad ill, I knew you'd be the one to keep it real
And I can't even lie dawg, when I see y'all it gives me chills
And I'mma stand behind y'all because I know the way you live
Aye just do me this favor, give it time, time reveals
When the sun dies
And the stars fade from view
Our love will remain real and true
Through the distant
And cold depths of space
The radio sings our song
It's a love real and true
We've been in the same place
For a long, long time
If our hearts go the wrong way
I still know you're mine
Should we even try to fight it?
If our love is trapped in all ways
I know that things been rough
But when you're by my side
It's more than enough, yeah
For us to make it through the test of time
When the sun dies (when the sun dies)
And the stars fade from view (oh yeah)
Our love will remain real and true

Standin' in the middle of humility
Can't nobody ever love you more than me
Can't nobody never love you more than me
If love is all you need, I'm all you'll ever need
I can never be scared of commitment
I can prevail through life without bein' malicious
I can't hold you for responsible for your mischiefs
I hope you are never huntin' me with vengeance
I'm not predictin' anything, I'm just listenin'
Congratulations, you made it, you coulda missed it
And I'm acceptin' your past but forgiveness
And with all the mistakes I've made, you're still listenin'
When the sun dies (when the sun dies)
And the stars fade from view (from view)
Our love will remain real and true
Through the distant (through the distant)
And cold depths of space
The radio sings our song (yeah yeah)
It's a love real and true

Hard times inspired me, concrete, that lion turf
45, my iron work, I'm a real nigga, that's after birth
Astronaut, and that's after Earth, scientology turned the cake
And I know I can whip a cake, and I seen niggas infiltrate
This fly shit they try to confiscate, as I sit back and I meditate
I'm top dog and I'm emperor, all dogs gon' go to heaven
[?] with my mechanisms, all these bitches swallowin'

I was talkin' to God the other day, swear I was leanin'
God forgive me, forgive me, I don't know what to do
But just go right in the booth, and spit my heart and my anger
My closest friends givin' up, man they feelin' like strangers
I got my whole crib [?], with guns like a ranger
You gotta take me on a high speed chase before you catch me
You either live, you either die, that's the only way you'll get me
Aww man, aww man, I should have stayed at Colombia
It was times that I thought "What I'm thinkin', like why
I am who I am?" and shit I can't cry
I was built for this lifestyle, damn, honestly
From the gutter travelin' to another country
All kings need to be crowned, that's my pedigree

No longer can I remain earthbound
The future is now
Time and space are one in the same
Enough time in space and we running the game
Almost is unacceptable
The cosmos is a receptacle
For the spectacle of my ascension
Inhabiting multiple dimensions of perspective
All my actions selective
At all costs, I must obtain the objective
Regain the inception intended at the conception
A living lethal weapon
I'm the natural selection
Moving in my own eccentric orbit
A rebel amongst conformists
So far gone, you might catch me on Pluto
Four billion miles away
Do a whole week in one day
Live for keeping it real
You already know what it is
I rather ever speak without something to say
But if you can't remember the who, what, when, or the how
 the future is now

You say you wanna take a ride? Get in
I grew up on that other side, getting it in
You niggas selling a bunch of pies, snatch a Benz
I heard you say it's going down, I'm going in
Go tell 'em it's a homicide (murder)
Go tell 'em it's a homicide (murder, murder)
Go tell 'em it's a homicide (murder, murder)
Go tell 'em it's a homicide, ya ya
Fighting, shooting, killing, riding
Cripping, tripping, spitting fire
In the kitchen, baking pies
Taking mines, making mines
Yellow tape, black gun
Fill it with them hollow shells
And leave the scene bloody
Buddy can't nobody tell
Catch a plane to the ATL
Lay low in a cheap motel
Whatever suits ya
And get a few thangs from my cousin Future
Now I'm back on and popping like
Trapping, rapping in the cut
Talk shit, I fuck you up
They don't recognize who I am or where I'm from
So I hit the strip club banging twenty crip 'cause
Treble with the bass, put that thang up in yo shavening
And leave yo body bleeding on the pavement
You say you wanna take a ride? Get in
I grew up on that other side, getting it in
You niggas selling a bunch of pies, snatch a Benz
I heard you say it's going down, I'm going in
Go tell 'em it's a homicide (murder)
Go tell 'em it's a homicide (murder, murder)
Go tell 'em it's a homicide (murder, murder)
Go tell 'em it's a homicide, ya ya
[?] open up that fire
You gotta question a nigga standing next to you, cut him off
I grew up on the side you gotta make yourself a boss
Niggas'll shit on you any chance they get
Cross you out on a lick
If you ain't ready for the ending then quit
It's a dirty world, you gotta get your hands dirty
I'm going for the title with my hands on the rifle
I put in the same work you put in, survival
Looking at my rival, they looking suicidal
Keep them bodies off wax, I can spot a rat
Let the [?] play, brrrat!
You say you wanna take a ride? Get in
I grew up on that other side, getting it in
You niggas selling a bunch of pies, snatch a Benz
I heard you say it's going down, I'm going in
Go tell 'em it's a homicide (murder)
Go tell 'em it's a homicide (murder, murder)
Go tell 'em it's a homicide (murder, murder)
Go tell 'em it's a homicide, ya ya
Slang a bunch of packs, and go and snatch a Benzo
I played them streets as a young nigga, ain't never liked Nintendo
Them gangstas in the yard, them my motherfucking kinfolk
They'll kidnap you and yo broad (in broad) daylight, no pretendo
I grew up 'round a bunch of monsters, call that pressure on ya
Be so scared for ya life, you call the police on ya
You ready, say you ready
You gon' starve or you want fetti yo life'll change a second
Good or bad, don't open yo mouth, make sure you shut it
Ain't no telling who listening, make a wise decision
I'm from 'cross the tracks, like Boozie
Where you ride, you better know who shooting
You say you wanna take a ride? Get in
I grew up on that other side, getting it in
You niggas selling a bunch of pies, snatch a Benz
I heard you say it's going down, I'm going in

Fucking 2 bad bitches at the same damn time
At the same damn time, at the same damn time
At the same damn time, at the same damn time
I'm at Pluto I'm at Mars at the same damn time
On the sofa popping bottles at the same damn time
pps with the sack going crazy
Got some diamonds round my neck no fugazay
Bad bitches in the suite tryna to bathe me
Just a young hood nigga streets raised me
Working wit a unit tryna stretch it to another one
Drinking on that active and it's tasting like some bubble gum
Thumbing through a check born on a jet
Talking on the iPhone sipping out tha styrofoam
That dirty got my mind gone that money got my mind blown
VVS and white stones VVS and white stones
I'm rolling like a rolling stone
Free Bandz and Al Capone
And my cash way long (turn up)
I see a bunch of clones
I wear Gucci I wear Bally at the same damn time
On the phone cooking dope at the same damn time
Selling white selling mid at the same damn time
Fucking 2 bad bitches at the same damn time
At the same damn time, at the same damn time
At the same damn time, at the same damn time
I'm at Pluto I'm at Mars at the same damn time

Got that Gambino jumping out the gym
My young nigga serving J's that's how I clear 'em
Jumping cross me you know your chances slim
In my aviator Gucci like I'm driving planes
When I cash that cash money smell like cocaine
Doing Birdman numbers making flips like Jackie Chan
Walk inside the jeweler drop my bail on your ring
Spent so much in Louis gave me free champagne
In Bal Harbour shopping and they doing the same thing
And I keep my cup wit me like a pimp
I think I'm Magic Don Juan take a clip
Spike Lee need to get this shit on film (Movie, Future, Astronaut)
I wear Gucci I wear Bally at the same damn time
On the phone cooking dope at the same damn time
Selling white selling mid at the same damn time
Fucking 2 bad bitches at the same damn time
At the same damn time, at the same damn time
At the same damn time, at the same damn time
I'm at Pluto I'm at Mars at the same damn time
On the sofa popping bottles at the same damn time

It took me some weeks
Man that bitch got some head so good
You gone swear she ain't got no teeth
I mixed that Molly with that Nina
We laid up in the suit
I'm in the hood posted up
I know the police gone sweep
I keep a hood hoe
So I can keep that dope where she sleep
She down for a nigga
And she ride with her fo-fif
I put the AK in the name
But I keep it on me
I'm brand new when i step out
From my head to my feet
These niggas studying my photos
Trying they best to compete
I got a style so outrageous
I come through like a chief
I'm the commander on these streets
All you niggas know me

I Put Versace on my denim

Till I topped the charts
I serve my same clientele
Cause these cars unmarked
I'm runnin up to every car
Before the car even park
We went from Reebok and Girbaund
Now it's Louis Vuitton
You want to be future
I look at you just like you my son
I got a rap check
And all I hang around is that scum
And if I ever get in trouble
My bitch gone pay my bond
I told that bitch I need a yappa
And she went to the pawn
And I didn't have to tell her twice
Cause it was already done
These niggas showing off for me
So now they ordering ups one's
Been on some futuristic shit
Now I'm back where I begun
I got a bitch stay in the hood

With that chopper in her name
And keep it right on the seat

Put the codeine in the spite
And then I have me a drink
Smelling like a pound of loud
When I step in the bank
Future razor blade sharp
In the club with my shank
I'm on my rock star campaign
And I'm cool as you thank
You need to turn it to the max
If you want to turn up
You brought your girl to the club
But she leaving with us
I'm mashing off in the coop
Getting some head from a slut
And she catching everything
She wont spit it back up
I bought that bitch some Red Bottoms
Cause she down for the key
And she owns so many guns
She worst than Billy the Kid
I put that semi automatic in her name
And she with it
When you pull up with that cash
She gone serve you them fishes
I got a bitch stay in the hood
With a whole quarter key
With that chopper in her name
And keep it right on the seat

And it's a permanent scar, you can't forget who you are
Ain't no matter where you go, they say we are who we are
When you cook in the raw and you're bad from the start
You as cold in your heart, you as cold as your heart
And it's a permanent scar, you can't forget who you are
Ain't no matter where you go, you are who you are
And when you cook in the raw and you're bad from the start
You as cold as your heart, you as cold as your heart
I keep that same mentality when I was facing casualties
Goin' through my tragedies, I practice like a athlete
Wouldn't believe they had for me
Show and prove, don't make believe
I'll make you believe, all my thoughts free
Privet in a large coat
This ain't no shit that I wrote
I've been down this road before
And I've been on the rollercoast'
So many ups and downs and turns
Homies droppin' like flies
Full strapped forty times
Doin' it like send the city guy
While I'm on the road, doin' shows, takin' this ride
I just got to wear my ankle tracker, commit suicide
This the second time I'm goin' back in, the second time
You'll get a second chance at life, nigga I ain't lyin'
And it's a permanent scar, you can't forget who you are
Ain't no matter where you go, they say we are who we are
When you cook in the raw and you're bad from the start
You as cold in your heart, you as cold as your heart
And it's a permanent scar, you can't forget who you are
Ain't no matter where you go, they say we are who we are
When you cook in the raw and you're bad from the start
You as cold in your heart, you as cold as your heart
I gots the homies, they go hauntin' me, the world too
And they ain't comin' back home, they in the cemetery (rest in peace)
I wish I made this up, it was a fairytale
I know the kingpin's on, the name is Legendary
They smoke crack right now, this ain't a Tyler Perry
This be real about real life, it's very necessary
For me to go on in, so I went back in
Try to stay in this booth and never come out again
My lil' cousin called everybody and he's still fightin'
And I got killaz walkin' the yard, Future all they recitin'
And I can't forget ya nigga you did too much biting
But I ain't gon' hold no grudge, I just know your type
And it's a permanent scar, you can't forget who you are
Ain't no matter where you go, they say we are who we are
When you cook in the raw and you're bad from the start
You as cold in your heart, you as cold as your heart
I take a trip a rapper give, run up there like MX Miff
Go to New York with this girl and I come back with a lip
Break bread with my team
Partner money here, here
I ain't cut for this, I want my music global
I'm gonna see people bump their fist
I'm gonna change a nigga life
So he ain't gotta go through this
Don't get caught in my fit
Till I'm runnin' one o six
They tracked me 'cross the globe
You can have the fame
Just give me my soul
I could scratch these niggas and go back in that boat
Before I lose my respect
I stick to the code
I hold a toll on my shoulder
But I will never fall
No snitches allowed, case closed
And it's a permanent scar, you can't forget who you are
Ain't no matter where you go, they say we are who we are
When you cook in the raw and you're bad from the start
You as cold in your heart, you as cold as your heart
And it's a permanent scar, you can't forget who you are
Ain't no matter where you go, they say we are who we are
When you cook in the raw and you're bad from the start
You as cold in your heart, you as cold as your heart

I heard she keep her promises and never turn on you
I heard she ain't gone cheat and she gon never make no move
I heard she be there anytime you need 'er, she come through
Turn on the lights
I'm lookin' for 'er
I'm lookin' for 'er

Turn on the lights
I'm lookin' for 'er

But she a good girl
She been mislead
Now she ready for the world
I want your energy
To take control of me
I've tried to go to sleep
And seen 'er in my dreams
Just in case I run across her today I'm a stay clean
Just in case she recognize a face, send 'er to me
And tell 'er I've been lookin' for 'er with a flashlight
You can't tell a nigga nothin' because I got my cash right
And tell 'er if she honest and promise she stay true
Make sure, when you tell 'er, tell 'er we goin past the moon
Turn on the lights
I'm lookin' for 'er too
I heard she keep her promises and never turn on you
I heard she ain't gone cheat and she gon never make no move
I heard she be there anytime you need 'er, she come through
Turn on the lights

And it's only preparin' us, for what we got comin'
If they come your way, and you feel like runnin'
Run in my direction, and don't you run from me
'Cause anytime we get together, we gon' stunt them
And I'm applyin' major pressure, feel it in your stomach
It's lightnin', it's thunderin', it is striking got me wonderin'
Butterfly, butterfly

Is there anything you wanna know?
Is there any place you rather be?
You walk until your feet get sore

Runnin' with niggas that wanna see niggas that get it, and niggas to strive
And the real niggas is only come a boss

I know either way it goes, popo gone be there
Even when a nigga was broke, Scooter was always there

Young nigga play with keys, like a type writer

In a 4 door beamer, driving with a rifle
Nigga where you at, nigga we go pull up on ya
Young Bitch looking like Janet in the 80's

Boy, I'll bury you like Halle
And these hoes say I'm blind,
Cause I don't see nothin' wrong with a little bump and grind
Man I just received a package

And my pockets so fat, I'm startin' to feel contractions
And my cousin went to jail for them chickens
And he already home and that nigga must be snitchin'
Cut him off like karate!

UFC in my trunk, bet this gon' beat you up
Everything movin' slow, still ain't no keepin' up
Gator replace the seats, get your ass eaten up
Chopper behind the scene, truth still understood
Verse ain't the tryna trill, I won't talk with it because Suzanne
Hang in on the diamonds, flex it
Swinging on my complexes
Stuntin' on it like a bird
Make seven on it, whip the wrist
Nothing on it, don't fetch attention
Get your bitches, cold efficient
Gonna kill it on competitions
Sideline 'em, on suspension
Young Bill, turned to stone
Lil' Jim, Sweet Jane's Joe
Pump UGK's stomach full of stones
I be on the phone with Doe Boy
I be telling him, he inspired me to go harder
Know what I'm saying, real talk
My savages, my savages, my savages
I'm always dressing fresher than a mannequin
I grew up in a ruthless ass environment
I'm on the phone with yo, I ask him how the trial went
35 racks is how my day was spent
I gotta cock it back, that's how my day would get
You got me thinking all these bitches artificial
The way you acting you must don't respect a real nigga
Roll some herb up, pour some syrup up
They tried to infiltrate us and then betrayed us
I told you way before what happened they was hating on us
You know when we was juuging for it they was mad at us
Aye, this a letter for my dogs
How we let the money get between us
How we let these bitches get between us
How we let these niggas get between us
I got love for all my savages with itchy fingers
I got love but it ain't like the love I got for India
She held me down when I was broke, I got her to infinity
My lil dog caught a murder, gone for infinity
Dumping ashes on your obituary, I know you feeling me
RIP my GrandDad Quick, he should have seen this shit
20 thousand O's of child support, I seen that shit
Riding round with all them choppers, I done seen this shit
These rappers mad at me but these niggas ain't doing shit
And I just bought a pound of kush so I can smoke that shit
I went and spent a half a ticket at the dealership
The fame is doing a lot of damage to my friendships
If Esco didn't love me would've been done jumped ship
And it's the love from my fans got me still here
Monster!
Say I'm Illuminati, they tryna make me catch a body
I don't know when I'ma flip, nigga
Get me some codeine and sip, nigga
Big bank saying wipe a nigga's nose, my girl changed the lock on the doors
Before this shit pour up a fo', ain't falling in love with no ho
That what you want for me? That what you really expect?
You thinking I'm sitting up depressed?
I'm somewhere countin' up me a check
I hate I had to fuck with any of you niggas, that's my only regret
Drag the mink on the floor
The Cuban links on my ho
Ten whips in a row, who would think we were poor?
Who would think we was poor?
There's money laying on the floor
Got some hoes laying on some hoes
Got a shawty with me, she a pro
No she'll never meet another nigga not another nigga like me
Even if he got a billion dollars he can't make her cum like me
Who compliment you like me? It better be about an image
Tell me all of this a gimmick, they thought the whips got rented
Because the Spurs weren't tinted, I told em ain't got nothing to hide
I told em I'll do with the pies, told em fuck all of my roles, I don't even write
Ay, man, I'm pullin' out the mo'fuckin Rich the other day

I will show it
You ain't flowin' how I'm flowin'
That's why I'm goin'
Places you ain't goin'
And I keep goin' and goin'
Until I'm growin'
To a ?, I come ?
I picked that up from Rico
My cousin had my back from day one, mano y mano
I believe in keepin' it one thousand and stayin' humble
New route I chose to take through the jungle
Keep the same mentality when I was standin' on the corner
Hit the studio and split that crack and have you on it ( My folks done told me)
You deserve it

You deserve it, Future

I go so fuckin' hard, till my heart skip a beat
I always been expensive, ain't nothin' about me cheap
I'm the realest nigga you have seen
Since Michael Jackson, Billie Jean
All this pain, I can't even rap
Sometimes I feel I wanna sing
My passion (My passion)
It goes without me sayin'
The fruits of my labor, I laid down a solid foundation
You water a seed too long and it will grow
You stay down and grind for long and it's gon show
It brings water to my eyes just to hear me on the radio
You wouldn't understand the route I had to take to get here so
I worked for this (I worked for this)
It didn't come easy (It didn't come easy)
Most people hit me up and say these rappers cheezy, 'cause
You deserve it
You deserve it
You deserve it, Future
You deserve it
You deserve it
You deserve it
You deserve it, Future
You deserve it
I done paid so many dues

Everyday for me, a fashion show (Turn up, turn up)
I'm Future in this and I run Pluto (Space)

When changin' up the weather, it's so hard to be settle

Hundred percent chance I done doped up and laced that
Chillin' with my family, hangin' low, I embrace them
I told 'em if it's a problem, say it's a problem
I told you off the top that I was solid
I told you we get money, 'bout to peel out
I told you half of these niggas with me win now
My left and right hand Robert Horry

Most my nigga pop Xans unemployed

Maybe one day I'mma get off the drank
And maybe one day we can fuck in the bank
I made me a Porsche out of two and a quarter
I got to Morocco and lay in some foreigns
Then I go back to Onyx and find me that one I can fuck on
And touch on and turn up and turn on
We don't watch TV, we count Fettuccine
Four and a half, it's right under my beanie
I made me some snaps then I fucked on a genie
Put her in a cab and I jumped in a 'Ghini
You gon' need yellow tape when I step on the scene
When you send me an invite, I come with a bitch like
She wrapped up in plastic, got coke in the mattress
All of this shit is about living lavish
This money, these cars, and these bitches, these carats
These radical styles, I'mma give you a style
You can take it, your new style ain't gon' make you a pile
I been waking up to bitches in my hotel suite
We been gone on the molly

Light skinned bone the same color macaroni

And I'm back how you want it and I'm back and I'm on it
Made a film like Sony, fuck the fake and the phony

Taking pain pills on the plane, getting chartered
Popping tags on tags, I was starving

Turn a five star hotel to a traphouse
Roaches everywhere, like we forgot to take the trash out
Flood my cross with ice, getting money my religion
Got my baby momma and my side bitch kissing

This the sixth time getting kicked out

YOu was in the studio when I did "Chosen", my nigga Double D was there

Real, you know what I'm sayin'?
This that super Future, fire marshal Future, Future Hendrix,
You know the whistle, you understand me? Yah dig? Yah dig what I'm sayin'?
Hardly, hardly, hardly, hardly, hardly, hardly
Hardly, hardly, hardly, hardly, forget anything

Hardly, hardly, hardly, hardly, hardly, hardly
Hardly, hardly, hardly, hardly, forget anything

Crack in the bushes
I'm tryna buy me a new '88 Cutlass Supreme
Every day hustlin', I gotta go get it
I gotta get Wu-Tang, man, gotta get cream
Long as they print it, my niggas, come get it
All of my love, I gave it to my city
All of that game you gave me, can't forget it
All that finessin' you gave me, ain't forget it
I turned the whole world up
Now they wanna treat me like an outcast or somethin'
These niggas so broke, instead of go and get it
They'd rather go ask for somethin'
Remember them days I had to load it up
And put on my mask for somethin'
Remember we juuged for somethin'
Remember we take for somethin'
I spent 3 stacks on these Rick Owens, I try my best to forget it
I pour my life inside these poems, my whole soul and my spirit
I'm easily agitated, get intoxicated, tryna fight the demons
Tryna find right and my wrong, hope my legacy live on
Hope my legacy live on
That's why I wrote this song
I ain't have to write this song
Future Hendrix is forever
Hardly, hardly, hardly, hardly, hardly, hardly
Hardly, hardly, hardly, hardly, forget anything
You know I hardly forget anything

I see you Spin, this right here the truth
Future Hendrix, just like that

She recognize that I'm so thorough
I'm under them briefs, I'm all on her mind
She wanna look me eye to eye and tell me her lies
I had accepted you
Just like you came and never look down on you
Tell that lil nigga to stay in his place before I expose you
You take one shot at me, you know that'll 'cause an explosion
Never bite the hand that feeds you, nigga
You gon' pay a nigga, yeah, to squeeze the trigger
You an itchy finger blog type of nigga
And you know me, nigga

Baby girl sayin' that she miss you
Is it too late for a comeback
I had to live with this crown on my head
I don't got no regrets, I don't have no regrets
I got to live with this crown on my head
I got to talk to my homies a bit
Sorry to tell you I got to address it
Still in this game and I'm learning my lesson
Accepting the hate when it's coming
I jumped out the Wraith on them bums
Acceptin' you're wrong when you're right
I'm never gon' judge, no I'm never gon' judge
You got a nigga, but I know you love me, baby
I know you love me

I'm talking too cocky, I got so much juice
My wrist is too rocky, they done let Wop loose
I'm talking plug talk, this don't pertain to you
Cause I'm a trap astronaut, I use cocaine for fuel
You got a meeting with my shooters it didn't arrange for you
I bust your head and celebrate, man this champagne's for you
You're talking gangster but you'se a lame, this ain't the lane for you

Keep a bag of xannies if you tryna join the family
Got the sauce on me in this off white tanny
Puerto Rican freakin' oh she sneakin', I done ordered up
She was goin' in inside the spur like a party bus
Pardon me, before I take a greed I never brag or boast
She ain't speak no inglo, but I know she like to tweak that coke
Three exotic broads and I got 'em soakin' panties

Three exotic broads and I got 'em soakin' panties

Young, wild, and reckless
At least I ain't checkless
Rep the gang 'til I'm breathless
Rep the gang 'til I'm breathless
Young, fly, reckless
Rep the gang 'til I'm breathless
Gotta live a wild life
Livin' in the wild life
Haters in ya eyesight
Let 'em hear them loud pipes
Let 'em hear them loud pipes
Let the banger go
I was in Givenchy cruisin' in a Humvee
Wrap your homie a mummy, I turn him into a zombie
Most these guys be frontin', there's no way I'm respondin'
Ben Franklin's comin', they comin' in abundance
Do it how you want it, just do it ain't no frontin'
Took her out for a luncheon, I put it all in her stomach
Sippin' outta my cup and it's spillin' all on my money
High as a fuckin' cannon, my flow is all they demanded
I'm back like I want revenge, she lick it up off her chin
First I had bought a Beamer then I had bought a Benz
I pray for me and my niggas, 'cause we live a life of sin
Some'll get joined in, most of us born in
Open the door for me, I'm already goin' in
Pour up a 4 for me, I'm already on it
I peep the jealousy, I can see when it's comin'
She knew my drive, she knew how much I want it
See how I tried to give you numerous warnings
You wanna talk down on a nigga who born to win
Now you see that you lost out when you see what you went against
I give another chance to turn to a perfect man
I do this shit again, if I can be where I'm at today
Gotta live a wild life
Livin' in the wild life
Haters in ya eyesight
Let 'em hear them loud pipes
Let 'em hear them loud pipes
Let the banger go
I was in Givenchy cruisin' in a Humvee
Wrap your homie a mummy, I turn him into a zombie
Most these guys be frontin', there's no way I'm respondin'
Ben Franklin's comin', they comin' in abundance
Do it how you want it, just do it ain't no frontin'
Young, wild, and reckless
At least I ain't checkless
Rep the gang 'til I'm breathless
Rep the gang 'til I'm breathless
Let 'em hear the exhaust, show 'em you a boss
Peep how the Christian Louboutins look when I walk
Gotta live this high life when you in this wild life
Crush the haters with loud pipes
Crush the hater with loud ice
Gotta keep a drink cool
Bust a nigga, Tadoe
Runnin' up my pesos
Runnin' up my cake though
14 carat gold, I'm a motherfuckin' ruler
Upper echelon, you my motherfuckin' student
Niggas I'm a don, fuck around hit the stewardess
Percocets and Zans got my head in the clouds
Gucci with the Bape, I done started a style
Full grown ape, nigga sprayin' the crowd
Gotta live a wild life
Livin' in the wild life
Haters in ya eyesight
Let 'em hear them loud pipes
Let 'em hear them loud pipes
Let the banger go
I was in Givenchy cruisin' in a Humvee
Wrap your homie a mummy, I turn him into a zombie
Most these guys be frontin', there's no way I'm respondin'
Ben Franklin's comin', they comin' in abundance
Do it how you want it, just do it ain't no frontin'
Niggas I'm a don, fuck around hit the stewardess
Percocets and Zans got my head in the clouds
Gucci with the Bape, I done started a style
Full grown ape, nigga sprayin' the crowd
I be on the phone with Doe Boy
I be telling him, he inspired me to go harder
Know what I'm saying, real talk
My savages, my savages, my savages
I'm always dressing fresher than a mannequin
I grew up in a ruthless ass environment
I'm on the phone with yo, I ask him how the trial went
35 racks is how my day was spent
I gotta cock it back, that's how my day would get
You got me thinking all these bitches artificial
The way you acting you must don't respect a real nigga
Roll some herb up, pour some syrup up
They tried to infiltrate us and then betrayed us
I told you way before what happened they was hating on us
You know when we was juuging for it they was mad at us
Aye, this a letter for my dogs
How we let the money get between us
How we let these bitches get between us
How we let these niggas get between us
I got love for all my savages with itchy fingers
I got love but it ain't like the love I got for India
She held me down when I was broke, I got her to infinity
My lil dog caught a murder, gone for infinity
Dumping ashes on your obituary, I know you feeling me
RIP my GrandDad Quick, he should have seen this shit
20 thousand O's of child support, I seen that shit
Riding round with all them choppers, I done seen this shit
These rappers mad at me but these niggas ain't doing shit
And I just bought a pound of kush so I can smoke that shit
I went and spent a half a ticket at the dealership
The fame is doing a lot of damage to my friendships
If Esco didn't love me would've been done jumped ship
And it's the love from my fans got me still here
Monster!
Say I'm Illuminati, they tryna make me catch a body
I don't know when I'ma flip, nigga
Get me some codeine and sip, nigga
Big bank saying wipe a nigga's nose, my girl changed the lock on the doors
Before this shit pour up a fo', ain't falling in love with no ho
That what you want for me? That what you really expect?
You thinking I'm sitting up depressed?
I'm somewhere countin' up me a check
I hate I had to fuck with any of you niggas, that's my only regret
Drag the mink on the floor
The Cuban links on my ho
Ten whips in a row, who would think we were poor?
Who would think we was poor?
There's money laying on the floor
Got some hoes laying on some hoes
Got a shawty with me, she a pro
No she'll never meet another nigga not another nigga like me
Even if he got a billion dollars he can't make her cum like me
Who compliment you like me? It better be about an image
Tell me all of this a gimmick, they thought the whips got rented
Because the Spurs weren't tinted, I told em ain't got nothing to hide
I told em I'll do with the pies, told em fuck all of my roles, I don't even write


I'm way up here, for real I'm over here too you dig?
Running circles around these niggas
Running circles around these niggas, you know, crack

I ain't tryna see nobody, I'm on the gas
I ain't tryna see nobody, I'm counting cash

Keep my finger on the trigger at all times
For this cash I don't mind doing the crime (FBG)
Roll this gas in my pockets like I'm slime
Photo Phantom in your hood and I'm sliming
I stay alert, I got millions on my mind
Let's ante up, make me have to push your line
Bentley Spur with them goonies right behind me

I ain't tryna see nobody, I'm on the gas
I ain't tryna see nobody, I'm counting cash
I ain't tryna see nobody, I'm going berserk
I ain't tryna see nobody, I got this work
I ain't tryna see nobody, I ain't trying
I ain't tryna see nobody, I ain't trying
I ain't tryna see nobody, I ain't trying
I ain't tryna see nobody, I ain't gon' lie

Rolex shades, they don't make these in the States
Green faced Roll, I spent a 100k
40 milli Glock, .40 on my waist
A bunch of killers, dope dealers on the chase
Fuck the snitches cause I'm still pushing weight
I'm getting it in and I came from off the crates
Let's eat again, we done already ate
Fuck the snakes, brought 'em over in a Wraith

I ain't tryna see nobody, I'm on the gas
I ain't tryna see nobody, I'm counting cash
I ain't tryna see nobody, I'm going berserk
I ain't tryna see nobody, I got this work
I ain't tryna see nobody, I'm counting cash
I ain't tryna see nobody, I'm on the gas

I ain't tryna see nobody, I ain't gon' lie
I ain't tryna see nobody, I ain't trying
I ain't tryna see nobody, I ain't trying
I ain't tryna see nobody, I ain't trying
I ain't tryna see nobody, I ain't gon' lie
Chandelier diamonds champagne
I'm fillin' my cup up with good drank
I know these drugs could be good [?]
I fell in love like a new fragrance
New kids on the block I'm sensei
Hold the candles high in your memory
Spin the block and let it rain get it done, done
I'm the man, I'm the man like Mister Dun Dun
Its blood or die me and Guwop
I spent a house on my new drop
Pearls in your eyes ain't no shades for you
I'm hidin' money I dig the grave for it
I just wanted to leave with all shooters
I just left the club with all shooters
I became the plug got all shooters
I get molly percocets to all the shooters
Northside, Eastside, Westside, Southside, all shooters
If you represent the set, all shooters
You was raised up in the six, all shooters
Went to Paris for my niggas all shooters
They say keys open doors well niggas bells get your keys
Take them keys out the door cause nigga 12 'bout to leave
See I'ma give 'em hell a half a mil' on my sleeve

I have so so many piece that you can't sell that to me
See you talk a real good game but you can't tell that to me
I'm in the penthouse with some shooters in the room next to me
Got a Draco with my trick look like a broom next to me
And I'm higher than a kite feel like scrooms off of me
I turn your girlfriend to a mule she like balloons up in me
He can't see his momma strung out he refusin' to see
How you a G hanging with snitches that's confusin' to me
I just wanted to leave with all shooters
I just left the club with all shooters
I became the plug got all shooters

I fell in love like a new fragrance
Its blood or die me and Guwop
I spent a house or my new drop
Northside, Eastside, Westside, Southside, all shooters

Get that money and stay with the same niggas
I know that money can change niggas
They don't look at you like you the same nigga
I just hope I can remain humble
Hop out a Ghost in the jungle, I did it
Sell out of dope at the apartments, I did it
I'm about to cut off some niggas I know that ain't wit me
Runnin' with niggas that wanna see niggas that get it, and niggas to strive
And the real niggas is only come a boss
I know either way it goes, son it gone be there
I know either way it goes, popo gone be there
Even when a nigga was broke, Scooter was always there
I be pourin' up this 40, thought we wouldn't be here
I told you come to town, we have to persevere
I knew there come a time when we all be here
I blow a bag today, I don't do nothin' fugazy
I blow the bag today, walk in the mall and go crazy

High definition glass on my pinky finger
Niggas swimming in the water, no paddle
Niggas trying to walk with my shadow
Bought a bird on the bezel, I'm a well known rebel
Told a young nigga Freeband, Roc-A-Fella
Told a young nigga Freeband, Roc-A-Fella
You can turn this off and I can kick it acapella
We work the front street where mama said "Don't go"
We went there
Trap house at bomb with that crack, then we went there
Shawty don't fuck with these fo' seeds
Niggas be telling these days, be telling these days
Nothing but a bad little bitch in some red bottoms
And where ya mans at? Heard that the feds got 'em

Got the game from them old niggas
You gotta know where I'm from to get to know a nigga

I'ma kill the competition and I'm playin' for keeps
You see water drippin' off me then catch it
I turned nothin' into somethin', now I'm livin'
You neglected me, you know you shouldn't have did that
They was countin' me out, you know you shouldn't have did that
You didn't recognize my drive, shouldn't have did that
Now I'm flyin' every day, I won't get back
I just wanna be the champ for the misfits
And the ones that would say I couldn't do it
I got angels all around me, yeah, yeah
I got love all around me, yeah, yeah
I'll be a fighter 'til the end, 'til my last breath
I'ma hustle 'til my last breath
I got angels all around me, yeah, yeah
I got love all around me, yeah, yeah
I'll be a fighter 'til the end, 'til my last breath
I'ma hustle 'til my last breath
Who knew I would take it to a whole 'nother level
Who knew I've been racin' with a whole 'nother rebel
Shawty wasn't checkin' for me, mama wasn't checkin' for me
I hustle every day just so I can spend a check on you
You my dawg 'til the end, I got so much respect for you
I watched you give up on me, but I never lost faith, did I?
You didn't ever hold me down, then I bought a new safe, didn't I?
Paper plates flushin' in that Wraith, didn't I?
I'm built with a new reputation
Blood, sweat and tears are my new foundation
Obama on my main line, I could run the nation
I got angels all around me, yeah, yeah
I got love all around me, yeah, yeah
I'll be a fighter 'til the end, 'til my last breath
I'ma hustle 'til my last breath
I got tears in my eyes
My dreams all I got and I'll die for it
If I love it with a passion, I'ma ride for it
I had to spank lil' shawty with my jeans on
And I had my pistol in my pocket
Can't trust none of these bitches, gotta be cautious
Can't trust none of these bitches, gotta be cautious
I bought all the sodas at the gas station
I just put a famous bitch on rotation
I just put that famous bitch on rotation
I just put lil shawty out on probation
Paranoid, pull in the garage, one in the head
I'm on hydroponic nigga, full of bars and that red
I'm in camouflage and I fell in love with this bread
I don't ordinary no type of nigga, I don't beg
I thought I keep that tool on me everywhere
Spent a couple mill on my bitch last year
I just put a new whip on the E-way
Then I ran my bands back up like a relay
Certified junkie

I was getting dome with a Tech
Bitch, you ain't gon' get no extra parts pulling no faggot move
I just called my contractor, told him "build another pool"
One sitt in the back, one by the living room
I keep all my jewelry at the bank now
Alexander McQueen's therapeutic
Bitch, I'm getting the same money as Cam Newton
Ask me how it feel to be a millionare

The snake bites
The scorpion stings
Weak niggas plottin' to steal crowns from kings
But that weight's a heavy burden on even the broadest of shoulders
The thickest-skull thugs and even the hardest of soldiers
The climb to the top filled with pleasure and pain
Peril and loss, profit and gain
Many hands once held open for a pat on the back
Now grapes a knife in the night on a silent attack
They wanna stop you from loving'
Stop you from laughin'
Keep you in misery, malice and madness
They path in life is to make your path rougher
Your joy is their poison, your suffering their supper
Once success is tasted, they say that you changed
"I thought we was folk, man, you just ain't the same"
"Come on, let me borrow a bit off your name"
Be a sucker if you want, they gon' hate you just the same
When surrounded by darkness don't get swallowed by it
Pain, anguish, and fear, don't get followed by it
All habitual line-stepping niggas be quiet
You violate the game, you disqualified
Gone...

Toujours frais, je reste ÃƒÂ  la surface
Comme les glaÃƒÂ§ons dans mon Chivas
C'est pas du hennÃƒÂ© sur mon visage
RÃƒÂ©enchainÃƒÂ© sur le rivage
J'ai le AR, j'ai le ski mask
ChaÃƒÂ®nes en O-R sur le primate
Je suis la Stan Smith chez Adidas
Je monte ÃƒÂ  300 #LÃƒÂ©onidas
Ta vie ne tient qu'ÃƒÂ  un coup de fil
Ta hlel ne tient qu'ÃƒÂ  un coup de bite
Sergent Kopp'zer dans le cockpit
Trop de bling'zer pour le portique
Je suis sur le net'zer, dans la rue
MariÃƒÂ© ÃƒÂ  la haine comme Bellucci
NÃƒÂ©gro, tu es faux comme tes Gucci
Je sais plus quoi mettre, je suis trop bien loti
Je t'en prie, marche sur mes Zanotti
C'est le poids des armes, pas des mots, qui m'alourdit
C'est pas la branlette mais la roquette qui t'assourdit
Quelle marque de merde porte Matuidi
Chez nous en disant rien, on a tout dit
Toujours en live du vaisseau mÃƒÂ¨re
J'eus Alzheimer quand ils me questionnÃƒÂ¨rent
Quand je pense ÃƒÂ  toi, je pense missionnaire, pas lÃƒÂ©gionnaire
Je suis en poster dans la chambre ÃƒÂ  ta mÃƒÂ¨re
Dans le bureau du commissaire
Je suis cocaÃƒÂ¯ne, t'es somnifÃƒÂ¨re
Mon Dieu, comment autant de faux nÃƒÂ©gros prolifÃƒÂ¨rent
J'ai le meilleur flow de l'univers
Mon Glock ma premiÃƒÂ¨re femme, j'ai donc laissÃƒÂ© Lucifer
Je gagne ÃƒÂ  la loterie, fume 20 oin-j
Je voyage salement comme un lo-ki dans le va-ing
Quand ils m'interrogent, le harki parle ÃƒÂ  trois singes
Je te tire une balle gros comme un gnocchi dans le larynx
Toujours frais, je reste ÃƒÂ  la surface
Comme les glaÃƒÂ§ons dans mon Chivas
C'est pas du hennÃƒÂ© sur mon visage
RÃƒÂ©enchainÃƒÂ© sur le rivage
J'ai le AR, j'ai le ski mask
ChaÃƒÂ®nes en O-R sur le primate
Je suis la Stan Smith chez Adidas
Je monte ÃƒÂ  300 #LÃƒÂ©onidas
Ta vie ne tient qu'ÃƒÂ  un coup de fil
Ta hlel ne tient qu'ÃƒÂ  un coup de bite
Sergent Kopp'zer dans le cockpit
Trop de bling'zer pour le portique
It's murder for hire

And I ride for my real niggas
Only God can judge me
When you live in the field nigga

When I hit the scene it's homicide
Diamond pinky ring, a lollipop
Fuck the hate, I pull up in a drop
Diamonds colder than a glacier
Ballin' harder than the Pacers
I been tryin' to have some patience
Told my momma she should pray on it
Told the streets they gotta wait on it
She gonna put a nigga name on it
I just dropped a whole thang on it
I'm making U.S.D's overseas
That's U.S. Dollars that you can't achieve
Fucked my white girl, she said "Nigga please."
Fuck that white girl, she said "Nigga please."

Drinkin' on syrup, I'm rollin' up haze
Made myself a boss, a boss or a plug
Either way you put it, nigga, I'm good

Fiberglass, Ferrari leather, in designer shit that I misspell
YUGHH, look at the clues, the J's, the jewels, I mention the monkey
From sixteen years old, I'm whippin' in kitchens, fuckin' my junkies

The old Skateboard P, that's your favorite
Me and twenty girls doin' yoga naked
Frequency high, like a spaceship
She say that she like it and she's been exposed
The Gandalf hat and the weird ass clothes
That's Comme des GarÃƒÂ§ons and the Buffalo
I know guerrillas with the triggers that's on a banana clip
And packin' with the biggest missiles
These niggas is knocking over vehicles
These niggas ain't waitin' just to see niggas
These niggas ain't tryna hear plea niggas
These niggas like choppin' down trees, niggas
These niggas 1-2-3 and they squeeze, niggas
These niggas hit the weed then they leave niggas
Gee, nigga

Two Lambos, you need to let one go
All these drones while y'all smoke dro
Never honest, guy, I'm tryna let y'all know

Big ass bag but no man sandals
All that war, we need to let that go
That boom business, I'ma get that ho

Me gon' hit that line, say he got some bricks, young fresh, 'bout to buy 'em out
QuikTrip 'round the corner, dropped a nine
Got the J's in the hood tryna smoke a line
Cocaine, cocaine cowboy, like Mickey Munday
Take over the project, whip a line, me no wait
I keep a 45 in my coat, while I'm servin' dope
J's in my hood smoke that crack, say it give 'em hope
Serve a nigga whole brick, he hopin' that it come and go
Young nigga turnt up, spend that money with Casino!

Getting to the money, hustle life, ain't got no money
Even if I'm fallin I'mma land on a bed of hundreds
I know something, mama's life will never flourish
I swear to Lawd, I just left the bank
Hungry for more, wearin designer galore
Drink up to the floor, Rocky Balboa
And I got to find this on me, Rocky Balboa
And I'mma keep ridin shit, Rocky Balboa

Give me a set of keys or a melody and I'll go crazy
I'm blowin trees in my fatees ain't no Fugazzi
Even in them A1's I'm sure I got the same bipolar
The super charger going stupid hard, now I'm pullin up in the drops homie
You ain't never been this high
Good thing I got, I'mma own me a car lot
Spit fire to the studio, just like a trap spot, I've been fly
Ask cop guy, no lie
Went from getting a house bust to bustin a stadium
Only take a day off, getting them Benjamins
Runnin this trick, I'm runnin up in the mills
It ain't low key and that's new lingo, new millennium
I'mma spit a verse, I drew my 10 and i don't take this life for granted
Blood sweat and tears ain't just happening
I'm a free band nigga with a plan

Getting to the money, hustle life, ain't got no money
Even if I'm fallin I'mma land on a bed of hundreds
I know something, mama's life will never flourish
I swear to Lawd, I just left the bank
Hungry for more, wearin designer galore
Drink up to the floor, Rocky Balboa
And I got to find this on me, Rocky Balboa
And I'mma keep ridin shit, Rocky Balboa

With my back against the rope, selling dope, baking coke
Child support, no support
I still had hope, I always spoke
Banished into existence
I never lost faith, I kept my place
Paper chase every day
It's we sensei but it's why I stay
And I go ape behind this cake
I stay laced, look at my face
I can't see you, money in the way
I'm up to date in outer space
A new regime, a brand new day
I'm infamous, got lion trace
What I'm tryna say I'mma keep that fire inside me til my heart decay aye
Went from sellin yay (so what?)
To sellin verses (true story!)
The gift, the curse, I done been through the worse
They let the real for real surface
100 million dollars is my only damn purpose

Getting to the money, hustle life, ain't got no money
Even if I'm fallin I'mma land on a bed of hundreds
I know something, mama's life will never flourish
I swear to Lawd, I just left the bank
Hungry for more, wearin designer galore
Drink up to the floor, Rocky Balboa
And I got to find this on me, Rocky Balboa
And I'mma keep ridin shit, Rocky Balboa


No matter what you do, it's never enough
I don't understand these bitches, Drizzy
Tryin' to, hear all these niggas, they never say
Time after time after time
Money's all I get and still money on my mind
But I ain't never satisfied
And I ain't never satisfied
I found the one and say, I'll never cheat again
We don't talk for like some months
I ended up fucking with her friend
I ain't never satisfied
I ain't never satisfied
I'm putting pressure on these niggas and I know
But I still be on the road like I'm scared of going broke
'Cause I ain't never satisfied
I ain't never satisfied
I got a lot of money in the room
I gotta find a hotspot hot soon
I mix the rosÃƒÂ© with the purple juice
I hustle everyday and you don't have a clue
How do you get money and all your dreams come true
It's like everything that surround you get brand new
I can't never forget the struggle and I pay dues
Can't let the money and fame come between my crew
My veins still runnin' deeper than the ocean
Ordered up 10,000 ones and I throw it
Name a bag in the store that she ain't got
Name a designer store that we ain't shop
They ain't never satisfied
I told that bitch, I told that bitch
I told that bitch, I told that bitch
Yeah, this for the niggas with Benzes and the niggas without 'em
Scram, ho!
I told that bitch I'on't give a fuck about a Benz, bitch
I told that bitch I'on't give a fuck about a Benz, bitch

Graduated from the fabricated sabotages
Conversated with a lady goin' Lambo crazy
Bitch, you better cut it, shawty, I'm 'bout to cut you off
Oh, you greedy in Tahiti, I just seen you flaunt
Aye, tell that girl you 'bout to settle, whatchutola
Aye, see how she react when you're no longer in your Bimmer
Then she find out that the Bentley wasn't really rented
Can you sell a kilo? Help a nigga move a kilo
Oh, you want the private jet to take a flight to Rio
Can't no Maybach prevent a nigga from makin' mula
Oh, you gold diggin' diggin' graveyard loser
Ain't none of my cars American, King of Zamunda
Let's have a heart-to-heart, drink wine, make art
Backseat of the Benzo, the AMG
Can you love a thug, is all make believe
Pure fantasy, I see through it easily

I told the girl I'm 'bout to sell the Porsche, I'm tired of it
She go and told these folks I'm goin' broke, a smile poured
From my lips, cuz if I'm broke, it's only hearted
Broken records from broken English, that's all it
Hol' up and if I were, why would you throw a party?
Affection is so convenient when ballin'
Correction, these hoes don't mean it when fallin'
I guess that's why Lois can't be with Clark Kent
Fly on a nigga back while he Superman
But if I'm in a wheelchair, you still there?
Stop searchin' for words, I feel stupid, man
The shit is the Pittsburgh, I still care
White button downs and Emory scrubs
Had to write her birthday down because my memory sucks
But this shit comes back up like some acid reflux
Or a Michael Jackson jacket with some plastic zippers
I was zippin' through the city and I don't give a fuck
1994 Toyota Land Cruiser because
That bitch ain't never broke down on me, why would I do that to her?
Simple is it, symbolism, I'll pull up at a club
And might not never buy a new car again, if I can help it
Cause if I buy one then they gon sell ten, then what I'm left with?
Throw a nigga one on the strength, then we might could talk
Til' then, I'mma ride my fuckin' bike, or walk

Say she the greatest bitch I ever met, then show me some proof
These girls be droppin' these lies, these girls be makin' shit up
She don't wanna stand in my line, she tryna come to the front
Yeah, she love her country but hate American cars
For the shape of them, he'll have you know all of them bitches is foreign
If yellow seems to be the color in fashion
What happens to all of this good black pussy he keep ignorin'?
The world told him don't shit rhyme with orange
The girl is only with him because he's tourin'
Well go on angel, I don't blame you, don't hang yo head

With the luxury cars and the all the spending (spending)

You said you'd love me long time girl
But now you say I call you at the wrong time, girl
Oh you acting different (different), what you out here slipping (slipping)
Run the streets with these enemies and make me no difference
Show me that catalogue, to hermans I cope that
They said it only come in hard top, I drop that
Mama said you don't love me (love me), shit about to get ugly
Would you love me and fuck me, if I wasn't getting this money
If I ain't have that theory, five karat earrings
Girl would you love me for me?
When that money get low you started tripping
Now you walking out the door and you flipping
Even my mama said you wasn't gon' love me
From the beginning
'Cause I wasn't winning
I didn't listen
Could you love me for me?
Can you love me for me? (Can you love me? Can you love me? Can you love me?

Love me long time, love me long time
Love me long time, love me long time
Can you love me? (Can you love me? Can you love me? Can you love me?
If you love me (can you love me)
Love me long time
Love me all the time

With money and the fame and the women
With the luxury cars and the all the spending (spending)
Can you love me? (Can you love me? Can you love me? Can you love me?)

Keepin' it soft like a mink
Gold on my link, coke in the sink
Choppin' that work like karate
Swerve in the new Maserati
In a brand new Maserati
That's a whole lot of new money
Snatch it, then hide it from 12's
Movin' and squashin' them bells
Servin' the rawest of yayo
Beating that china like Kunta Kinte
Whippin' it, whippin' that dope
Drinkin' on syrup, I'm rollin' up haze
Made myself a boss, a boss or a plug
Either way you put it, nigga, I'm good
Triple salute, nigga, straight out the hood
Bakin' soda water splash the scales
Fork in my right and my pride in my left
Leanin' over, over to the side
I whip me a fourway to a nine
The dirty, the money is homicide
And my recipe can't be televised

Young enough to still sell dope, but old enough that I knows better
When they sayin' it's 42 for that white powder, I knows better
Get it nigga? I nose better, put a smile on the devil's face
Who don't wanna sell dope forever and flood their Rollie 'til the bezel break?
Woo! Fish scale in the two-door that I fish-tail
Fiberglass, Ferrari leather, in designer shit that I misspell
YUGHH, look at the clues, the J's, the jewels, I mention the monkey
From sixteen years old, I'm whippin' in kitchens, fuckin' my junkies
Pablo, Versace way before Migos
My dinner plates, no silverware, all you niggas my E-hoes
Toss a kilo like a free throw, crack house, it had the peephole
Made it through to the other side, now nothin's big as my ego
Young nigga move that dope

The old Skateboard P, that's your favorite
Me and twenty girls doin' yoga naked
Frequency high, like a spaceship
She say that she like it and she's been exposed
The Gandalf hat and the weird ass clothes

And packin' with the biggest missiles
These niggas is knocking over vehicles
These niggas ain't waitin' just to see niggas
These niggas ain't tryna hear plea niggas
These niggas like choppin' down trees, niggas
These niggas 1-2-3 and they squeeze, niggas
These niggas hit the weed then they leave niggas
Gee, nigga
If you got two hoes, you need to let one go
Two Lambos, you need to let one go
All these drones while y'all smoke dro
Never honest, guy, I'm tryna let y'all know

Big ass bag but no man sandals
All that war, we need to let that go
That boom business, I'ma get that ho
Young nigga move that dope

How you think about that coupe, with no roof? Young nigga cashed out
Pass me the purp, pass me the zan, young nigga 'bout to pass out
Swerve I'm behind her, I got some in the car, young nigga 'bout to smash out
Me gon' hit that line, say he got some bricks, young fresh, 'bout to buy 'em out
QuikTrip 'round the corner, dropped a nine
Got the J's in the hood tryna smoke a line
Cocaine, cocaine cowboy, like Mickey Munday
Take over the project, whip a line, me no wait
I keep a 45 in my coat, while I'm servin' dope
J's in my hood smoke that crack, say it give 'em hope
Serve a nigga whole brick, he hopin' that it come and go
Young nigga turnt up, spend that money with Casino!

Audemars on your wrist, that's just something for the day
Driving Rolls for the week, in a 'Rari for the skeet
Got a condo for the month
You'll get massages for an hour
Red lipstick on my body print
I can smell you seducing, I promise
Come here, you swear I'll be yours, you swear I'll be yours
You drink and I'll be yours

We done painted a portrait, we lookin' back at our fortune
We are love, we are love, are love
Ain't neither one of us perfect, we just scratchin' the surface
You would think we did it on purpose
I don't know if it's virtuous
I don't know if it hurts you
Everything is worth it
