And most these niggas say I sing too much and
I don't really show up my bling too much and
I don't really show off my cars too much and
I don't really be with the stars that much and
I don't like to kick it with such and such and
These niggas like bitches, they talk too much
It's tryna be just like you, they stalk too much
And bitch you can swerve with the Zoo on the weekend
Fifth of Patron and we gone and we freakin'
Bitch super wet, make her squirt when I'm deep in
Makin' her moan and my name what she screamin'
Guap with the bands, Poppa Smurf start to tweakin'
Jump in my six so fast, high screechin'
Everything blessed, I could ball for no reason
Hop on the jet, start to glide through the season
End it for a while but they do not believe
[Hook]
And this is for my young niggas, aye
Cause of where we from all we know is our environment
And you can't change what's understood, aye
And if it's all good then it's all good, I'ma rep my hood, aye

I pull up in my beamer
I ball and start to flexin'
Used to stay in the traphouse
We servin' fiends they breakfast
All I do is count money
My lil brother stretch it
Don't get shit on my hands now
My shits too fuckin' special
Big ZooWap from the bando
I'm sendin' you a message
Everything that I land on
I swear to God I smash it
And my whole damn camp on
I heat it up then pass it
Every beat that I wap on
I put it in a casket
Hit the gas on my spaceship
I hate waitin' in traffic
Like they all at a standstill
My ZooWap fuckin' passin'
Chaos pull out that 40
He doing too much yappin'
I am G.M.O.B
We folkland get it crackin'
How you stand on yo block
without yo pistol boy you lackin'
Pillow talk to them bitches
Bout me boy I'll found out faster
How you stand on yo block
without yo pistol boy you lackin'
So don't talk to them bitches
Bout me boy I'll found out faster (Aye)
Bands all in my Robyn jeans
Niggas trynna rob me
Fuck nigga betta' duck
Fo' I get the Tommy
Ridin' in the drop top with a mami'
Hunnid bands Imma drop soon on my timepeice
Tints all on my beamer boy
ZooWap I'm so special
Came on up from nothing
Now it's money in my dresser
Only jeans I rock
I waste five hunnid just to dress up
Stupid live in the woods
ZooWap rollin' faster
Had to tip my fuckin' six
I floor it, it go faster
ZooWap from the trap
I swear my sack is a disaster
Different color twelve twelve
Skinnys in a plastic
You gon' need a fuckin' phantom
If you trynna match it
Grit and dice on twenty eight
Trappin' out the mansion
Old school days
Box chevy for my grandma
All I wanna do is whip
And put ZooWap on the landmark
Through these streets I'm movin quick
Like Big ZooWap a land shark
Talkin shit can't leave yo block
That's how you get yo landmark
Heavy cheese, my neck on freeze
And Gucci Mane my role model
Everytime I hit the club
We pop atleast bout' four bottles
Everytime we leave the club
You see all the hoes follow
If that nigga actin crazy
He gon' get the whole hollow
ZooWap I don't give a fuck
Got sympathy for nobody
All they gotta do is cut the check
I go get bout' four raris'
ZooWap I'm the motherfuckin' best compared to nobody
Laser tips will beam you up
But baby weon' know scotty
ZooWap I'm the motherfuckin' best compared to nobody
All they gotta do is cut the check
I go get four raris'
Laser tips will beam me up
But baby weon' know scotty

Don't worry 'bout my niggas 'cause I got 'em
My niggas stack they money just to spend it

And if you ain't beefin' 'bout no money, then what's the problem?

On everything, for 17 I'm wildin'
Treat my whole squad on a island
Ziploc gang, bring a lighter

When you're with him, I swear I'm always on your mind
I had to stop you girl cause you were so damn fine
I know you're with him now but soon you will be mine
If I could bring it back, I'll probably press rewind
Rewind, rewind, rewind, rewind
Rewind, rewind baby, rewind, rewind, yeah
I know you're with him now but soon you will be mine
If I could bring it back, I'll probably press rewind
Hit the trap with a whole key
Blowing dope by the OZ
Behind tints moving low key
I think that you should know me
Yeah, I heard that you taken
I think that I can change it
The look on your face
And probably think I'm playing
Look how you love to hate him
Like your smile and your hairdo
Chop it up over here boo
Take the top off the convertible and show off your hairdo
The one I attend to, the one I am into
If I pull out the beamer, I'ma cop you the Benz coupe, baby
'Cause we be all night, baby
Don't turn off them lights, baby
I wanna see you fight, baby
I'ma make you mine, baby
Do that thing I like, baby
Eating you with ice, baby
Do that thing I like, baby
When you're with him, I swear I'm always on your mind
I had to stop you girl cause you were so damn fine
I know you're with him now but soon you will be mine
If I could bring it back, I'll probably press rewind
Rewind, rewind, rewind, rewind
Rewind, rewind baby, rewind, rewind, yeah
I know you're with him now but soon you will be mine
If I could bring it back, I'll probably press rewind
I said love and loyalty, what do you call that?
We used to play fight, smoke weed and fall back
Even late night, whole freaks'll call back
If I had a chance, I'd bring it all back
You could be Gina and I will be Martin
And you can be Gabrielle and I'll be Dwayne Wade
I know you very well and we want the same thing
But, life ain't a fairytale, my niggas gangbang
Just to be honest, I think she in college
If life was a VCR, I would rewind it
Take off your Vicky bra and let me inside it
I might get excited if I get invited
But, baby don't fight it
'Cause this is celebration every time we united
Just show me how you feel
'Cause you ain't gotta hide it
And you can take the wheel
If you know how to ride it, if you know how to ride it
When you're with him, I swear I'm always on your mind
I had to stop you girl cause you were so damn fine
I know you're with him now but soon you will be mine
If I could bring it back, I'll probably press rewind
Rewind, rewind, rewind, rewind
Rewind, rewind baby, rewind, rewind, yeah
I know you're with him now but soon you will be mine
If I could bring it back, I'll probably press rewind
