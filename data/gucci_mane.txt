Two times, it's gucci, Two times  
Zugi Zugi  
Burr burr burr burr, burr burr burr burr, yeaaa  
  
It's two times gucci  
And I don't give excuses  
I use to drive a hooptie, but now my life a movie  
A genius like Confucius, but please do not confuse me  
Don't think cuz I do music, I won't pull up with Uzi  
They want me just like Tookie, But Gucci Mane survive  
Don't ask me nuthin stupid, they bury me alive  
Right now I'm on that new shit, my struggle I embrace it  
Forever live in diamonds, like ancient kings in Asia  
Big ballin is my major, I still got my lil trap house  
A condo flip a Florida, I'm ballin on you stakehouse  
I'm in and out the trap house, but this ain't what you wanted  
I put my shooters on ya, you think your house was haunted, Fool  
Pounds in the bathtub, keys on the dresser  
My money in a great place that I can never tell ya  
A cinderella story call me Cinder-fella  
I make it rain so much the strippers gotta bring umbrellas  
I double spike the punch, Skip breakfast and lunch  
I sell a thang, and whip a plain, and eat some captain crunch  
I smoke a blunt then go to brunch, and babe I don't do dutch  
I let ha order what she wants, order what you must, it's Gucci  
  
A they don't think I would be back I told them wait and watch  
All you waiting watching kick back and factor this  
O maker ain't no coming after this  
We the realist niggas coming from Atlanta streets  
Yall thought Atlanta rap was all novelty, Where you was at?  
I was sit N trenches trying to escape the poverty  
Probably out sellin sacs, Or what?  
Or probably trying figure out where the fk you and your sacs... At  
And way before I was sellin sacs, What?  
5th avenue, what were you doing?  
I was on the avenue pitching quarters, taking orders  
But now nigga the consumer, I'm a Zone 4 nigga I hit the yams up in my pum's  
These nigga grew up with a silver spoon, I had to dust the vault  
Had to learn to wiggle up had to get it up  
Nigga playing cards in the hood, but I ain't playing  
Hell I'll throw in ya hands if I had yall hands  
Got niggas that will cut off their hands just to have my hands  
I'm that nigga now, look at you, you doop dealin  
100 percent legitimate yea, I'm doop dealing  
My name O weight, I carry my own weight

(Intro: Gucci Mane)  
I wanna thank God  
For opportunity, success  
Wealth and health  
  
(Verse 1: Gucci Mane)  
My daddy name Gucci, he the Gucci Mane  
Honestly he turned me on to the ice game  
He fed the fam with 3 tops, that's the current game  
Well fuck you, who are you?  
You ain't God mane  
I fell out with my right hand man, he tried to top on me  
I guess it's clear we ain't homies like I think we homies  
I'm at the top and I swear to God, it's really lonely  
But I'm not coming down, no stoopin' down, I keep it movin'  
These young nigga's got no respect who make music  
Broke ass nigga never can get used to it  
And the bottom of some valley don't do it like the top do it  
Roll the crisp we hear ak's more than church music  
  
[Hook:]  
I hit this car, horse on the car, with the top off it  
Topless broads drivin, Gucci chargin' with no problem  
Hit shot dead in the bushes with his head off  
Head cut off, those slick blood knocked off  
Decapitated (Huh?)  
Decapitated  
Decapitated (Bang), bow down  
Decapitated (It's Gucci)  
  
[Verse 2: Gucci Mane)  
I know African's that cut off legs  
Jamaican's that cut off heads (What's up bumbaclot)  
This millionaire still in the feds  
You in the county and you can't get outta jail nigga?  
Damn, that's so sad  
That's so bad  
You played out, jj bad  
Mob ties put a head in your bed (horse head)  
You touch Guwop and they goin' mine and wrap yo head  
I got so much overhead, I gave him diamond bricks instead  
And I chumm without a charm, diamond chain and watch instead  
Team some team  
My grandad in house and I stay next door to Ned  
Cooking dope instead of eggs  
Hundred pt's in my fridge  
  
[Hook:]  
I hit this car, horse on the car, with the top off it  
Topless broads drivin, Gucci chargin' with no problem  
Hit shot dead in the bushes with his head off  
Head cut off, those slick blood knocked off  
Decapitated (Huh?)  
Decapitated  
Decapitated, goddamn  
Decapitated

Wanna buy two extra commas,  
All my shoes are Fara Gomma?  
Lightning actually hittin' thunda',  
Even Stevie Wonder wonder,  
Why yo girl get home on time so much I had to change my numba',  
Sarcasm, these bitches need to ride 'em while I pass 'em,  
I wouldn't even give that bitch a orgasm,  
Miraculously my niggas stand beside, not in back of me,  
So disrespect my faculty, how dare you have audacity,  
The compact to capacity I cash out automatically,  
I spit these rhymes so radically, sporadically, fatality.  
  
[Chorus]  
I got the green, drank, pills, blow,  
Runnin' round the town gettin' money I suppose,

Trees to that paper so I'm something like a kite,  
Loud stanky kush and it tellin' me to light,  
Extra loud diamonds and its lookin' like a light,  
Rolli'n stay money and my pockets just glide,  
Everyday diamonds cause they don't like to hide,  
V-V-S light yea so you block yo eyes,  
Burnt color diamonds like a sweet potato pie,  
Hit ya color diamonds and get ratchet like a fly?  
The brick man, the bread man I don't tell no lies.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Money Mane gettin' it in, I'm only in it to win  
I ain't come to say I'm the champ, I get bored and do it again  
If I ev'red across a tranny, I ain't asked her for a twin  
cause its number time, done came to gather up all my inns  
it's fifteen minutes to ten, eighth in and I'm drinkin' gin  
I could act like we were fiends, but I dont like to pretend  
I got 30 stacks new Ajax, it's the future price of my air max  
I'm addicted to abllin' I hear Lennox Mall and I relapse  
Your slimfast, little bankroll, my stash getting way to fat  
No push-up, just cook-ups, I'm booked up, I don't wanna lapse  
There's Money Mane, and Juice Mane, and Gucci Mane and ol' Brickman  
I got juice all in my kitchen so my house smell like cocaine

East Atlanta slum man is where I come from  
Pass that bubble thrax and put this bean on your tongue  
Now everything was gravy 'til your bitch came in  
Bout the same time that that thang kicked in  
Now she ain't really pretty but she got a nice body  
I'm geeked up thinkin' this Buffie The Body  
Ain't your name 'lil Trina cause you look like Janet Jackson  
I'm off three double stacks and I'm lookin' for that action  
Gucci Mane you stupid man I love the way you flowin'  
Ridin' in my drop but I don't know where I'm goin'  
On two eighty five I keep ridin' in a circle  
The inside of my ride smellin' like a pound of purple  
Gucci is your time give me five more minutes  
And a cold orange juice cause I'm really really trippin'  
Went to the strip club and request that I'm da man  
The next thing you know I was throwin' rubberbands  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Verse 2]

But I wish I had a lie detector test right now  
You say you marry well bitch you might be  
But I bet your husband ain't Icy like me  
She stand on B.C. in my ashy black tee  
When dem dope man nikes and dem jore ass jeans-Jordache Jeans

I'm a the shit in East Atlanta baby ask about me  
Pop one pop two two halves that's three  
Ain't no waffle house baby hell I can't eat

Wearin' doces in the club cause you kno the boy geeked  
Top the top on that thang let you see my seats

[Chorus]

Gucci Mane the fly nigga get your mind right  
Or a cries by the twelve like a case of budlight  
Sell a cush by a bell so you kno might shit tight  
See I'm 30 in the morning on a all night flight

So tell me when to go like my name E-40

Do you remember when (remember when)  
Do you  
Do you remember when (remember when)  
  
[Chorus]  
Do you remember when  
I met you girl everything was alright  
Do you remember when  
We got a room we was fucking all night  
Do you remember the time girl  
Like I remember the time girl  
  
Girl you my type you just right  
That blouse on you fit just right  
Them jeans she got on skin tight  
Shes sexy cool but still shy  
I'm colder than a Klondike  
Bipolar I got dumb ice  
We know each other we go together  
Like hamburgers and french fries  
Everything's all right  
We'll never have a fist fight  
But last night we had a sex fight  
Then told her have blessed night  
I'm leaning I'm meanin'  
I fall asleep might have dreams in it  
Did the club thing, brought my team in it  
Last night I bring my queen in it  
I go get it you bullshitter's  
I hit it, damn right the kid did it  
You hood critters and hood chickens  
Please stay out my business  
From south France to south Philly  
A.T.L. to north Memphis  
From my city to your city  
Think you got more swag but not really  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Yo yo yo  
I'ma put it down so  
Gucci gon' wake up sore  
Ironic its gon' hurt  
But when I'm gone  
It'll make you want more  
Scented aura candles  
I pull up in my Lambo  
The best sex that you never had  
Two bad streets off the main road  
You had her but she left so  
That's just the way the game go  
No one on my level  
So please get up out on my lane holmes  
I met a girl so real no need to bring no game home  
Reminisce of Gucci every time they play my same song  
I'm on her like a long john  
Short skirt with no thongs on  
Sexy naked sunbathing outside my house with frames on  
I took her from some busters?  
And that boy ain't gon' shit bout it  
Its alright we can tell that sucka to forget about it  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Girls to my right  
Ladies to my left  
The weathers so hot  
Snows on my chest  
When I see this fly girl  
Tried to get her number  
Then she tells me  
I already smashed last summer  
Mile high club G 5 planes  
Remember back rubs and pink champagne  
Mile high club G 5 planes  
Remember back rubs and pink champagne  
  
Do you remember when  
I met you girl everything was alright  
Do you remember when  
We got a room we was fucking all night  
Do you remember the time girl  
Like I remember the time girl  
  
Do you remember when (remember when)  
Do you  
Do you remember when (remember when)

So many P's at the trap then they would smell the shit  
It's Guwop

Don't knock this  
You nigga's lazy y'all need to watch this  
Preposterous

My phantom was seen on candler  
You ride the transit  
No options you niggas can't act like y'all forgot this I'm tired  
But switch ya flow up it's so monotonous it's my metropolis  
I'll drop a 12 on ya so colossus!  
My swag plus my drop top yellow jag why they gossip  
I'm the nigga upload your twitter bitch I'm the topic  
Profess it but  
Gucci didn't graduate from college  
Your girlfriend say's my ear rings are erotic  
My lambo doors open upward they're robotic it's Gucci  
  
Gorilla goons with the tool down to act a fool  
Birds in the living room it's like Atlanta zoo  
Lions, tigers, minks crocs and gators for my shoes  
Monkey nigga's in my hood I'm living in the zoo  
Birds in the living room and the kitchen too  
I'm a tiger in the bedroom ask your baby boo  
I got lions, tigers, bears in my hood and closet too  
But my gun can stop an elephant just like Atlanta zoo (Gucci)  
  
Drop beam  
Off set things color ice cream  
White dreams  
She can fuck me that's a pipe dream  
S-O poppin' x-pills so exciting  
My ex chick n ex homeboy uninvited  
Cases of ace of spade bitch getcha wasted  
The waitress I made her reloaded like the matrix  
I lean laid with a bad bitch black n' Asian  
On 20 headed to buckhead I'm racing baby  
But take that fake jewelery off that shit is fugasey  
You think that you're hotter than the kid you're mistaken  
Real n you nigga's really really good at faken  
So trill I'm a keep it real I'm back to the basics  
  
Gorilla goons with the tool down to act a fool

Heads up  
My partner stashin' bricks up on his roof top  
Whole key, half a key, quarter key  
Gucci got more quarters than a motherfuckin' jukebox  
Pop-pop hear the glock cock  
And I gotta Colt 45 like Billy D  
Semi automatic that I keep up in the attic in shank  
That shape like Tennessee (ugh!)  
I cut ya  
I cut ya til the white meat  
And my partner pushin' more crack than a bike seat  
I smoke the best I get my dro' from California  
Get high n go to sleep you couldn't wake me from a coma  
I might wake up if these rappers got beef I smell the aroma  
But these niggas ain't got no heart not even if they had a doner  
I roam the streets so who the fuck is YOU  
Southside Collipark king of the jungle my name is Ludacris living in Atlanta
zoo  
  
Gorilla goons with the tool down to act a fool  
Birds in the living room it's like Atlanta zoo  
Lions, tigers, minks crocs and gators for my shoes  
Monkey nigga's in my hood I'm living in the zoo  
Birds in the living room and the kitchen too  
I'm a tiger in the bedroom ask your baby boo  
I got lions, tigers, bears in my hood and closet too

Payed a quarter million dollars just to beat a murder case

Payed a quarter million dollars just to beat a murder case  
They used to run up on me be like Gucci what you know  
I told 'em get this glass and get da fuck away from me hoe  
And every where I go it became an instant cut  
'Cause they knew I had them 20s and dem big fat monkey nuts  
  
Cant be scared of a dog when you come from Monten Park  
Shootin' dice and playing cards selling blow all at the park  
Had it fresh on yo sister but I used to serv ya momma  
Breaking 50s down to dimes was my job for da summer  
And my job for the winter cookin bricks all in da kitchen  
Junkies dead at the carwash cause I heard dat dey was snitchin'  
Dope jumpin' out da gym man it helped me buy my tims  
Dope fiend willy used to finger fuck my rims  
Smokers didn't know my name so they used to call me black  
If ya beat me for a twenty betcha ima call you back  
She on da dope mans dick 'cause I'm a nigga with a sack  
I'm the hustler of the year and I know that for a fact

Prices so low that they call me thrift store  
Standing at the store while I'm selling yayo  
Bought a brick yesterday gotta four way to go  
On the five way everything gotta go  
Fifty on the table hundred on da floor  
Middle of da summer but I'ma make it snow  
Like a chia pet my money gone grow  
Still servin niggas through my burglar bar door  
Jordans jeans and a little afro  
8 ball jacket and a pair of stash slips  
I don't give credit that's how a nigga get killed  
And if you got a tilt ya car get peelt  
17 going to da 559  
Like a blind man I don't see know lines  
Thirteen when a nigga did his first crime  
Eighteen when a nigga bought his first nine  
Lyin' I'm frying and I sure aint flying  
Cookin' up dope cause the Jays keep buyin'  
Robbing crew lurking I know they trying  
Try Gucci man they ass be dying  
Let me take you back in time  
Let Gucci man refresh your mind  
I'ma dope boy stay on my grind  
A good plug is so hard to finddd

We used to be good friends now she can't stand me  
Her man ain't G her man  
Ain't me her man can't be what her man can't be  
My jewelery game fridgy white watch blizzard  
Crocodile lizard pinky ring ignorant,  
I'm careful who I step too when I step too  
And if I choose first she choose me then she special  
Long walks all night dog I can help her bless her  
Show her how to be successful kiss her Gucci her up finesse her  
Sudden valley cook up second of the extra  
Stack up loud pack make her catch a contact  
Dumb sets long stacks I can make her come back  
  
[Chorus]  
I can do bad bad bad bad bad all by myself  
I can do bad bad bad bad bad all by myself  
I can do bad bad bad bad bad all by myself  
I can do bad bad bad bad bad all by myself  
  
I'm a bad boy but still there's so much good in me  
You can take me out the hood the hood is still in me  
I needa girl to feel herself but can still feel me  
Just let me be ya only choice no need for plan B!  
My love life is malnutrition's you my vitamin C  
Stay down like Hillary and I can be ya billy  
I'll buy ya jada pinky pinkies I'm the biggest willy  
Just when I give it throw it back just like we playin' Frisby  
I can do it by myself but I'd be very lonely  
Be the diva who's my lover and my closest homie  
So if you sick and tired of bein' sick and tired call me  
Pick up the yellow pages and look up Gucci! (Gucci!)  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Ain't no need in arguin' about it  
If you wanna leave then just be bout it  
There's no sense in blamin' me and me blamin' you  
There's no reason to be untrue everything  
I got I work hard for everyday I work hard to  
Make more I can do bad all by myself  
I ain't tryna play love games cause I can do bad baby  
  
[Chorus]

Them bitches wanna trip  
Them bitches gettin' murked  
And stick em in tha dirt  
And gone 'bout our business  
And it ain't nothin' personal  
It's all bout tha figures  
It's M.O.E. till a bitch a dead  
And I don't give a fuck about what a bitch said  
I'm still gettin' money I'm still gettin' rich  
I'm still that woman that will take your dick  
Yeah, tha truth hurts, you still gotta face it  
I spent ya whole deal on my ring and my bracelet  
It's top notch twat

But I'm a beat it up

I'm a beat it up  
He can lay you down  
But I'm a beat it up  
I'm a beat it up  
  
I hopped up out my bed  
Got my swag on  
Stronger than fillet Mignon  
Two Gs blown just for cologne  
Money never limited  
So Icey with benefits  
My driver needs a passport  
All my cars are immigrants!  
It's so sickening  
History you're witnessing  
I had a girl she quit me  
Now I'm single want to get with me?  
Sticky again they stick to me  
If you see your chick with GUCCI  
Think before you confronting ruley  
Ain't my fault your lady choosin'  
430 stepped on purp it  
08 verty rollin' dirty  
Wardrobe clean as this detergent  
Got your girlfriend picking purses  
Say she lonely  
Gucci only one with to meet me in person  
When she met me home  
My bitch told me that shes over first  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Your girlfriend keep callin' me  
I feel like she stalkin' me  
You at home  
And she with me  
So morning it's an argument  
Gucci Mane be doggin' it  
Beatin' her down  
Straight poundin' it  
Drillin' on your sheets  
Got your blanket at the laundromat  
Wait baby girl throw it back  
Old man might catch heart attack  
Gucci Mane not hardly that  
Smack you like I'm mad at that  
Swear this sex so passionate  
Oral sex she mastered that  
Pornographic poses  
Like she posing for the internet  
Wait I was not finished yet  
Never been a minute man  
Always been a business man  
Gotta catch your feelings man  
Got a man?  
Oh really now?  
Acting like I give a damn!  
  
Used to like her now I don't  
Got a real short attention span  
Gucci!  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Gucci Trey Songz put it on  
My shirt off when I perform  
She say this her favorite song  
She got on my favorite thong  
She so hot  
Too hot to touch  
Truthfully too much for lames  
Gucci mane I'm extra game  
So extra rubbers I'm a bring  
Got your main thang screaming Gucci  
Every Tuesday night we cool whip  
Wish we could do it more often  
But I'm often somewhere flossin'  
Lay it down like carpet barbie  
Aston martin double park it  
Beat it like we got a problem  
Pop her till she call me poppa  
Freakin' partners  
Why we never bother with a second option  
Hoppin' got the mattress poppin'  
Rockin' while her girlfriend watchin'  
Freakin' partners  
Why they never bother with a second option  
Hoppin' got the mattress poppin'  
Rockin' while her girlfriend watchin'  
Gucci  
  
[Chorus]

Break a line to a bunch of dimes then you grind up  
Money got me sure my ass can't even hold my pants up  
Twenty niggas standing on the flat all getting off  
Found a jacket, get em bro, late with his head soft  
Try me in the six, I'ma raise this forty five up  
Shave a brick, put it back together, that's a lineup  
We mix the chick, use a little cut, that's a temp fade  
And if he got a chopper never ever bring a switchblade  
  
I'm a multimillionaire, I got a couple hundred on me  
And no more mac, I told the scrap, I make you stick yourself like Tony  
I give a nigga my whole stash if he can take this jewelry off me  
And I'm so bossy in my altar, smoking kush and sipping coffee  
Walk, walk, walk  
  
They said I couldn't get rich, I hid that money (pick up that money)  
All that sideline talk don't make no money  
Bout that bread, y'all niggas out here too funny (y'all niggas too funny)  
Hit your bitch then leave her with no money (she broke)  
They said I couldn't get rich, I hid that money (I did it)  
All that sideline talk don't make no money (y'all niggas out crocked)  
Bout that bread, y'all niggas out here too funny  
I hit your bitch then leave her with no money  
  
Money is a motto, if you speak it then I'm with ya  
Any sideline nigga, they get cropped out the picture  
If you ask me, yeah I'm ready, got your hoe on a mission  
Catch me running through your city like a damn politician  
Boy I'm all about a chick  
She don't ask no questions, boy she all about the nig  
Say she want to crash so I let my partners rip  
Looking at this nigga that stay flyer than a jet  
They don't hear me yet  
  
I'ma get that check, that money  
Y'all niggas out here funny  
You know y'all nigga on the go  
Gotta have that green light gumby  
I'ma fool with it though, too clumsy  
On the clock monday through sunday  
Everyday gotta get that money  
And I learned that from the big homie  
  
They said I couldn't get rich, I hid that money (pick up that money)  
All that sideline talk don't make no money  
Bout that bread, y'all niggas out here too funny (y'all niggas too funny)  
Hit your bitch then leave her with no money (she broke)  
They said I couldn't get rich, I hid that money (I did it)  
All that sideline talk don't make no money (y'all niggas out crocked)  
Bout that bread, y'all niggas out here too funny  
I hit your bitch then leave her with no money  
  
I'm like eleven of them back, give me that fucking walkie talkie  
Then get lost cause when you said you'd never cross me then you crossed me  
And these hoes count the vapors like biz marquee  
It's since they brought me these keys, niggas idolize me  
Critics criticize me, haters sabotage me  
I get angry then I cut through whoever camouflaged veep  
Better workers, that's my killers, ain't gonna jeopardize me  
I know these fuck niggas with they could paralyze me  
Walk, walk, walk  
  
They said I couldn't get rich, I hid that money (pick up that money)  
All that sideline talk don't make no money  
Bout that bread, y'all niggas out here too funny (y'all niggas too funny)  
Hit your bitch then leave her with no money (she broke)  
They said I couldn't get rich, I hid that money (I did it)  
All that sideline talk don't make no money (y'all niggas out crocked)  
Bout that bread, y'all niggas out here too funny  
I hit your bitch then leave her with no money

I smoke blunts everyday, to try to wish it didn't happen  
But I can't bring him back, cause I am only a mortal  
People think I'm a god, but to me I'm only normal  
I used to trap on the corner, trap ? with the thermal  
I had that TEC in the bushes, run up on me I burn you  
Folks they come to Atlanta, just to ride through my zone  
Wanna see where I trapped at, they wanna see what's my home  
In the place that I said, everything that I meant  
I got so many pounds in the apartment think I got dreads  
I got money in the bed, so I sleep with the bread  
If you play with Bricksquad, them might take off your head  
  
I'm so high, fuck nigga I'm so high  
I'm so high, baby girl I'm so high  
She get high, your baby girl, she get fucked up  
And he get high, you know that nigga fuck his nose up  
I'm so high, fuck nigga I'm so high  
I'm so high, fuck nigga I'm so high  
She so high, but bitch with me so she good night  
And you so broke, you looking at us with all this ice  
  
Bitch I bigger pay her or get bigger paid, everyday is a bigger day  
Bigger nigga get a bigger gun, hit his ass in his bigger face  
Bigger ? and I fuck with him, half the niggas he with her don't like  
That young nigga 'bout trigger play, and my section Lil Jay like nigga day  
Reiterate I'm 'bout pistol play, anything with my pistol say  
Shoulder deep in this cocaine, but nigga I can hold the weight  
Appraise me, I'm a mill' today  
A mill, and a mill, made a mill today  
Say you wanna do a show, what's the rate?  
Told a nigga fifty with a steel face  
Smoking on kush and I'm drinking on grape's, I feel just like I'm Pimp C  
Say Gucci Mane you a murderer, so you can't get a sponsor like Pepsi  
Say Pepsi, fuck you, cause I fuck with the Coca-Cola anyway  
On check day it's booming, but it's real slow on rent day  
  
I'm so high, fuck nigga I'm so high  
I'm so high, baby girl I'm so high  
She get high, your baby girl, she get fucked up  
And he get high, you know that nigga fuck his nose up  
I'm so high, fuck nigga I'm so high  
I'm so high, fuck nigga I'm so high  
She so high, but bitch with me so she good night  
And you so broke, you looking at us with all this ice

[Chorus]  
I'm the boy from the block, boy from the block block  
I'm the boy from the block, boy from the block block  
I'm the boy from the block, boy from the block block  
I'm the boy from the block, boy from the block block  
With the very large knots  
I'm the boy from the block, boy from the block block  
I'm the boy from the block, boy from the block block  
I'm the boy from the block, boy from the block block  
I'm the boy from the block, boy from the block block  
With the very large knots  
  
I pull up in that Spyder, strapped up like McGyver  
Should have brought my phantom na, but I'm mad at my driver  
He so fuckin' turnt up, ridin' on auto pilot smokin' kush and smilin',  
He drinkin' while he drivin'  
Gucci please excuse me , huh, all my goons got jewelry on 'em  
All my niggas booked up, paper they get it on there own  
I don't think you know me homie, I suggest you leave me alone  
I got so much jewelry on, that I think I need a clone  
I pull up to the traffic light, icy as a blood light  
Shinin' like a flash light I might damage ya eye sight  
Gucci got that real ice, don't it look real nice  
I don't want your girlfriend homie but my bitch might  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Now straight to the channel shop, that's how she shop  
500 for the flip flops cause they ain't Reebok  
I'm the boy from the block with the very large knots  
Gotta spot in the hood no sofa just pot  
I'm hot, so hot stand next, get shocked  
I got Caucasian neighbors that's just how I rock  
If you talkin' to me tell me somethin' that I wanna know  
If she ain't got no money know you gotta have some doe  
Then she ask me for a drank so I bought a bottle  
She was flexin' really hard, now she flexin' harder  
You a bitch, one more bitch, I only fuck with starters  
So if you ain't a dime piece, ain't no need to bother  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I want the money, I smell like a pocket full of hundreds  
A whole bag full of Kush I been buckin' since a youngin'  
I know you need a man right now because you strugglin'  
So if he isn't helpin' then there's no need for discussion  
In Houston Texas I can spend fifty thousand on a Monday  
I got fifty woman with me, fifty more that ain't comin'  
My pocket do the conversation make all the decisions  
I only fuck with bad bitches cause I'm very picky  
He cant buy a drink so he don't deserve ya digits  
I'm polar bear laflare, wrist and ear is very frigged  
My charm big as a midget  
I give yo ass the business  
So if you got yo swag right you know that you can get it

Dropped the top on your bitch, now she looking at the stars  
Diamonds dancing on my wrist, you dancing with the star  
Gucci Mane so geeked up, he don't care you light or dark ho

If Gucci Mane just bought why the fuck he paint it darker  
That shit was already hard, Now he made it harder

I just got out found out who got clean lean  
And gas weed and Miley C  
Peewee Longway with me that's my blood brother  
Two pints of P's on us so we mud brothers  
My life's a gangsta movie man I love colors  
I'm in a red bentley Brooklyn it's just me and Thugga  
They say I'm getting skinny but all of my blunts stuffed  
Ain't nuthin' skinny but them skinnies on my bentley truck  
This molly really got me thow'd up in a Mulsanne backseat  
Pow'd up two three's of the codeine  
And feel I'm bout to OD  
I'm in a rari but I'm runnin from the police  
A carbon 15 on me and an ounce of OG  
These niggas say they know Gu-wop but they don't know me  
Ten G's of molly on me so I brought sand to the beach  
  
[Chorus:]  
I'm in a ghost same color dope  
Feel like I just came here on a banana boat  
Come to my store, knock on my door  
Soon as I get rid of them I got plenty more  
Like Curtis Blow I got to blow  
Like Bruce Leroy I got to gloat  
I do a show like I'm selling dope  
I rep for the hood it's a dope show  
  
[Verse 2: PeeWee Longway]  
Me and big Gu-wop servin them bricks of du-wop  
Them drummers south bricks to d-block  
They bookin' those shows for re-rock  
Money four door so now I'm re-routin  
Looking at a real dope boy with cleeves out  
Lebron James shooter trekkin what the heat brought  
Real dope boy finnessing with the sheet rock  
Feeling like Wayne put it on mamacita  
Hit the block break it down serve James Ether  
Fuck a thought with drop with the egg beater  
Pull up in a drop top but I damn need her  
C-Note say we not done counting 20's  
Me and Wop in a Bentley flying down 20  
Pourin' mud so dark think we sippin' henny  
Got a bitch so bad call her dream of Jeannie  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Verse 3:]  
Dope show doing shows like I'm sellin' dope  
I'm counting 300, 000 now while she snorting coke  
She mix her coke with heroine then she call it speed ballin'  
I miss my cooking with OG I hear that weed callin'  
I'm on the phone slurring my words because the lean talking  
Sipping champagne shoppin' for jeans I'm in mini markets  
Trying on giuseppes with a niff and with a beam on it  
Smelling like I just smoked a half a pound of green homey  
The choos got me looking lean homey  
They say the robins looking mean homey  
But I ain't sticky cut some lean on it  
They say I'm picky bout' my weed homey  
These niggas trick u with the lean I put PT's on it  
These niggas killin' what they eat homey  
They'll treat you like a piece of meat homey  
So don't get butchered in the street homey  
I ain't had no work in like 2 weeks homey  
I gotta feed the streets plus Gu-wop gotta eat homey  
  
[Chorus]

[Hook:]

My big toy meet me o I got it in the choke hold  
Spent a half a million last year on forgiatos  
And no I am not a catholic confessin is a no no  
So many bricks of brown and white you know we got a

A little handgun in every pocket in my cargo  
And it's a stack for a kilo if you get it in the jungle

Cause I'm much more than a man

Now that I'm finally free

Super high can't touch the ground  
Life tested me but god blessin' me  
Every sixteen bars is testimony  
From the jailhouse junk to the Testarossa  
I have find myself then remind myself  
Woke up I'm grown I gotta blame myself  
Streets taught me everything I train to sell  
Did wrong so long know didn't know nothin' else  
Then my lima crew was like me a member  
Think every man worth, enemies himself  
Glad as well but I'm mad as hell  
Cause my best friend probably gon' die in jail  
I ain't no lie to tell prolly cry like hell  
If I dwell on it 'cause he got a eighty years  
I'm going hard see I might as well  
Guess I gotta a hard head like my daddy had  
And my daddy dad my great great great great  
Grandpa had a really crazy swag  
So I stand a day  
Diggin' down a grave  
That if I can change now  
And my mind is made  
A got a point and prove  
And a sign to raise  
Can't let them make mistakes  
That his daddy made  
  
Finally free,  
You're never send me away  
Took everything that I had  
For me to follow the plan  
Now that I'm finally free,  
I'm 'bouta throw it again  
I take my life in my hands  
Cause I'm much more than a man  
Now that I'm finally free  
  
Squash the beef im free of that  
This crazy summer ain't feelin that  
I guess they wanna see us kill each other  
If im dead who the fuck gon' help my mother  
I done struggled to hustle im too hard for this  
I done rushed and killed ain't proud of that  
Smoke weed took pills sold powder patches  
I'm a solider I understand where the cowards at  
My home boy gone where the flowers at  
Out of money and the work can't bring that back  
If I had one wish, wish momma there  
Could come down now and see me rap  
But she see me now and I believe in that  
Wanna script of that, I ain't going back  
So I put my family on I my back  
Lost so much I cant pay that back  
I was lost but now I'm found  
I was blind but now I see  
Super high can't touch the ground  
Life tested me but god blessin' me  
Every sixteen bars is testimony  
From the jailhouse junk to the Testarossa

Like Steve and Pass  
Say boy you lightning fast  
On the Utah Jazz  
Like Dr. J shorts  
My work real tight  
You got that Atlanta Hawks yay  
It wont get right  
Catch me on the rebound  
Like Bo Outlaw  
I'ma Mikey Vick-it whip it  
Cook it south-paw  
36 hoes-zos  
Trying to make the end zone  
Make no hard move  
And use my cell phone  
Worth scrabbling in the pot  
Just like Steve Young  
5 for the Keyshawn  
7 for the Dion  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Gucci on fire  
Like mojo crack pot  
Fell ova a joint  
Like back like crack rock  
Money stupid dumb  
Just like Cold Blood  
Just Young Hot  
I show no love  
Money getter like Cheeba  
Minds like Fat  
And my trap roll hard  
Just like Shorty Black  
I'ma country ass nigga  
Just like Ace  
Gotta fetish, for the stones  
Just like Four Trey  
Money tall like Broah?  
Yours like D?  
And my patience very short  
Just like Courtney C  
Angie B, Russell P  
But its your choice  
My girl Angel pussy deep  
Like Slick Man voice  
Like Red 03  
Man I got bread  
My pocket on swole  
Like HP forehead  
I'ma money go getter  
So I contest  
Gotta a hundred hoes jockin'  
Just like Throw Back  
  
[Chorus]

Yellow benz wit a spoiler kit wit my spoiled little chick  
Yellow diamonds on my neck and wrist match this yellow bitch

If you don't buy her what she want then she throw a fit  
She a bitch shawty mean as shit but she super thick  
And she act silly like a kid give her candy stick

I know she not a groupie so I let her in my coup  
I snatched her in my fender while I stashed her in matire  
Susie is a money maker but that bitch a liar  
Susie roll in 08 walry but that girl on fire  
Pull us over down the road said she had some priors  
Ten bricks in my car shawty singing like mariah  
Singing like the choir better yet singing like mya bitch  
  
Well my name is susie and gucci think I love him  
That sucka think I'm loyal but I fucks with all the hustlas

Two jobs she get cheese her dates are my treat  
How neat she loves to eat we eat bon appetite  
We feast she so neat and like me she so neat  
  
Niggas always talk but I run the block  
This bitch is so hot my clip is close shot

My hos hos will pop like young goldie locks

Got a plug in arizona but used to slang on the corner  
Got a chocolate nerdy lookin chick a ryder like wynona  
Ima tax my city plenty when she come from california  
You are not the owner of that car that is a loaner  
I got money stacks as tall as you cause that's just my persona  
I got half a million on my neck come try me if you wanna  
Keep a shooter with a chopper turn you to a organ donor  
  
Chorus x2  
  
Verse 2  
My flow so skitzofrantic that I think I need a straightjacket,  
Straight drop dope flow put me in a crack baggie  
Old school like a 1960 cadillac  
Real well known in every hood that's why these nigga's swagga jackin'  
You're not in my league nowhere close to my tax bracket  
Brick squad charm bout the same size of a tennis racket  
Thirty round tone in my jeans got my pants saggin  
Let yo girlfriend give me becky now the bitch braggin  
Rims to the white chain to watch hat to the shoes matchin'  
Since I'm Gucci Mane might as well buy her some new glasses  
Everybody still lookin at me when my vette passing  
Brick squad ceo I guarentee the check cashes  
  
Chorus x2  
  
Verse 3  
Six stoves in my house and everybody cooking  
Ferrari pass by damn everybody looking  
A couple million dollars and I'm still straight crooked  
You might had the game on hold but I took it  
I'm hoppin out the drop lambo like a kangaroo  
Gucci brick squad ceo but tell me who the fuck is you  
Like simon says yo' big sister do what I tell her to  
I take risks from the bubble kush and then you know I sell it too  
Milatary rifles you would think I was a ex-marine  
Sk, street sweeper, mac 90 or m16  
No I'm not a fighter or a lover I am just a shooter  
So if you disrespect my squad I'm a have to shoot ya'  
  
Chorus x2

While Zay control the symphony

It'll make her hyperventilate  
Yea I'm a bachelor but I'm workin' my masters  
And no I'm not a doctor but my money  
Go way past one, shes hotter than my last one  
Sexy like my last chick I'm checkin' out her assets  
Her ex-boyfriend is past tense

I rap to her she walks to me and damn her walk is sexy  
Our last night was so good I think about her next day  
More but then four ashtrays she told me boy you crazy  
Burnin' all my candles and lighting all my incense

And I think I love this girl because her price is hella cheaper

Running around town with them choppers about the same size

She knows just what you like, I know just what you need  
If them white girls you like, bet I got one of your type  
Have a blunt for the day, brunette for the night

Look here, I ain't got time for no romance  
Cocaine avalanche, when I finance

Since you a chrome snatcher, I'ma throw a chrome at you

Put 2 swishers together look like I'm blowing on the flute  
Yeah nigga we... We ride up on you

My pockets on swoll' my rims all grown  
When I hit the club everything goes  
Bottles in the air put your lighters in the air  
But when I'm in here I don't really care  
Cause I ride on 'em I style on 'em  
Yea I lean on 'em yea I flash on 'em  
Yea I know that's the way you like it huh?  
Yea that's the way you love me huh?  
  
It's alive its alive rounds kill the eyes  
I had to bring the bitch back like Frankenstein  
I push weight but Gucci don't exercise  
I get extra from whipping up extra pies  
I'm in a hood like the mayor 'round election time  
Here's a suggestion don't park your car next to mine  
I'm a star when the light hit I'm supposed to shine  
Your flow is garbage they let me out just in time  
They got a section but none of the hoes are fine  
They need to exit don't let the grind past you by  
I run laps round lames with my shoes untied  
I jump the line walk in and watch the crowd divide  
Still stuck outside its the ugly side  
Look Medusa in the eye and Medusa died  
This top secret shit classified  
Don't blame me swizz was the mastermind  
Cant breath cant breath tone tony brush the time  
I keep my chain moon walking Michael Jackson time  
I keep on buying ice like I lost my mind  
This little light of mine is supposed to shine  
  
My pockets on swoll' my rims all grown  
When I hit the club everything goes  
Bottles in the air put your lighters in the air  
But when I'm in here I don't really care  
Cause I ride on 'em I style on 'em  
Yea I lean on 'em yea I flash on 'em  
Yea I know that's the way you like it huh?  
Yea that's the way you love me huh?  
  
Hurry up hurry up Gucci on the news  
They said he walked out the chair rocking stupid jewels  
They tried to find what it do they made that Jew confused  
Too much cash on my hundred falling out my troops  
A yellow wrist bright as piss bitch I'm the shit  
Big Gucci called swizz lets make a hit  
Two things in this world I ain't never seen  
Are you a foreigner nigga I need to help to get me mean?  
I hope you suffocate me totally baby let me breath  
Cause I don't chase nothing but paper bitches chasing me  
Excuse my french I'm Gucci I'm so fucking gutter  
It don't make no sense to switch for none of these motherfuckers  
  
My pockets on swoll' my rims all grown  
When I hit the club everything goes  
Bottles in the air put your lighters in the air  
But when I'm in here I don't really care  
Cause I ride on 'em I style on 'em  
Yea I lean on 'em yea I flash on 'em  
Yea I know that's the way you like it huh?  
Yea that's the way you love me huh?  
  
So not to say my life is it  
I said no doc my wife is it  
Now I'm back back going like I never never left  
Plus the boy right here I'm fresh to death (whoo)  
Chris Jones on my feet see I can't fall from Suzuki jeeps  
Now I'm jumping off decks  
The word about the haters they can be upset and  
The black card in my back pocket  
The corner sig' is looking like a speeding rocket  
Yeah I'm zooming on a highway  
And you should love me I did it my way  
  
My pockets on swoll' my rims all grown  
When I hit the club everything goes  
Bottles in the air put your lighters in the air  
But when I'm in here I don't really care  
Cause I ride on 'em I style on 'em  
Yea I lean on 'em yea I flash on 'em  
Yea I know that's the way you like it huh?  
Yea that's the way you love me huh?

[Hook: Verse Simmonds]  
It's not a day that goes by  
(Ahhhhhh)  
That I don't wanna look in your eye  
(Ahhhhhh)  
Girl you so fine, I might try  
(Ahhhhhh)  
To fuck around and lick you dry  
(Ahhhhhh)  
It's not a day that goes by  
(Ahhhhhh)  
That I don't wanna look in your eye  
(Ahhhhhh)  
Girl you know you got that fye  
(Ahhhhhh)  
If you don't give it to me I'll die  
(Ahhhhhh)  
  
[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]  
She so fine it'll make you cry  
Make you smile, even make you lie  
Make me cum and I don't know why  
Got me acting dumb and I don't know why  
Some say I'm sprung and I'm young  
And I'm dumb, full of cum  
I'm a fiend, you the drug  
I'm high  
Baby so fly, [?]  
Baby drive,  
I'm too drunk to drive  
Sliding down Ocean Drive  
Driving a Lambo like New Jersey [?]  
There's two freaks inside  
Pull up in a [?] suicide  
I propose a toast  
Got a bitch so bad I wanna boast  
[Chorus:]  
I'm fucked up!  
You fucked up!  
Selling Niggers where's your stash  
You just blew your luck!  
Jack boys on your ass put your chain on top,  
I ain't talking about a name but my  
I'm fucked up!  
You fucked up!  
Telling Niggers where's your stash  
You just blew your luck!  
Jack boys on your ass put your chain on top,  
I ain't talking about a name but my  
  
For big Gucci OJ  
I put the cross on  
For now it comes the thunderstorm  
Couple Niggers down to murder for a couple strikes  
Brick squad, brick squad, everything is brick squad  
Seein a bitch nigga dead make my dick hard.  
Is only one word I can't take is the fear.  
I'm dying for my Niggers!  
My Niggers die for me!  
Like a midget to a train. ain't no stopping me  
No!  
I'm writing for my Niggers!  
My Niggers write for me!  
I'm my brother's that we got is real.  
  
[Chorus x2]  
  
I'm not the bad Niggers or the biggest one  
But if you beat us, son,  
I get a bigger gun!  
I walk a lot of jewels  
And plus a lot of tools  
I make a lot of shops  
I make some mortal soup.  
It's such a beautiful day,  
To put my diamonds on display  
Black and yellow diamonds catchin sun rays on a sunday.  
You're a man or a mouse?  
He's a fucking mouse!

Yeah  
Its Gucci,  
Whats up baby,  
Yellow err'thing this time, you know what I'm talkin' bout  
Yellow rims, yellow, big booty, yellow bone  
Yellow lambs, yellow M-P's  
Yellow watch, yellow charm ring, chain  
Yellow livin' room set, Lemonade Gucci shoes for my girl  
Gucci!  
  
My phantom sittin' on sixes, no 20's in my gun  
Your cutlass motor knockin', because it is a lemon  
I love dem Georgia-peaches, but you look more like a lemon  
These sour apple bitter bitches, I'm not fuckin' with 'em  
I'm truly stupid paid that's just how I feel today,  
I'm movin' slow cause codeine syrup's in my lemonade  
I'm standing in the shade and I'm sellin' lemonade  
600 a pint ago and raise off in the Chorus  
Jacuzzi on the roof, ugly hoes don't get the time of day  
Cheifin on sativa smell the reefa from a mile away  
Pistol in my coupe, try my troops you'll get blown away  
Gucci Mane got long money, bitch, that's all I gots to say  
Gucci Mane got long money, that's what them bitches say [x3]  
I aint even gotta talk my money conversates  
  
Verse 1  
Bitches think I got a money tree, I drown the bitch with money  
Ferrari with them bumble bees, Four Giovanna sittin up under it  
Makin' love to the money I swear the sex great  
I kick dem hoes out but let the money stay  
Makin' love to the money like a sextape  
I'm talkin' Kim K I'm talkin' Ray J  
Makin' love to money on da interstate  
Can't keep my hands off her we on a dinner date  
I'm makin' love to my money shawty keep me straight  
I can't live without her I fuck her everyday  
  
Shawty stayed by my side when I started grindin'  
She da main reason why a nigga shinin'  
Strippers can't see me all dis money flyin'

Fucked her best friend, she sucked then you kissed her  
Fucked her best friend she sucked me then you kissed her

Same plan, different angle  
Want to tangle with Gucci  
So your life you want to gamble

And you Auntie numbers like candles

Who know somebody who know somebody who got the mollys  
Karate Kid but I don't even know karate  
Kush got my eyes low like Mr. Miyagi  
East Atlanta Santa, yeah my stomach fat and jolly  
Fucked up 50 grand in Vegas with my nigga (?)  
Got the battle of the bands going in my Robin's  
And if you think of robbin Gucci, you gon have some problems  
Servin' pizza pies, all my pies got extra toppings  
And I be shittin' on all these niggas just like pigeon droppings  
Thirity grand in all hundreds, I don't do the wallet  
And I'm about to fly to New York cause I'm going shoppin'  
  
I take a brick, break off a brick and cook a deuce  
Way I'm beating up all these babies call it child abuse  
Way I'm beating that white girl, that's domestic violence  
And my money talk for me cause I be being quiet  
  
[Chorus x2]  
Quiet, quiet, cause I be being quiet  
I let my money talk for me because I'm being quiet  
  
Break a 4-way off a brick and then I'm bout to fry it  
My money gettin' obese, your shit is on a diet  
I sip lean all day every day until the kid is tired  
I make em search for that ? cause this pussy's wired  
If you think you can defeat me, fuck it nigga, try it  
I got squares all in my trunk I think he wanna buy it  
Got a G-4 but I do not have no one to fly it  
I'm so fly that I might stop rappin' and be a pilot  
Gucci Mane the shit and you can't deny it  
I got the game in a knot and you can't untie it  
I let my money do the talking, I be being quiet..  
And I get money out the streets but keep my business private!  
  
I take a brick, break off a brick and cook a deuce  
Way I'm beating up all these babies call it child abuse  
Way I'm beating that white girl, that's domestic violence  
And my money talk for me cause I be being quiet  
  
[Chorus x2]

I'm a real nigga, talking 'bout what I really have  
Cause I fucked a nigga bitch, that's why he really mad  
Hit a nigga in his head, I be really glad  
Since the day I lost Dunk, I been really sad  
A nigga make a hit and dip, will he really last?  
A nigga say he hold you down but will he really blast?  
They say I'm worth fifteen M's but that ain't really shit  
And I ain't content with what I got, got to be really rich  
Sold dope on the really, was broke on the really  
If you really wanna get it then you know I'm with it  
Really wanna go to war with me, not really  
You wanna get it then you gonna get it  
You worth a mill', not really really  
I ain't all in your business  
If it's not your girl not really really, then why is it hurting your feelings?  
  
My young niggas, they really ready  
Straps cocked, are ready

Your girl with me, you really married, damn I'm fucking your marriage  
  
My young niggas, they really ready  
Straps cocked, are ready  
These rap niggas are really scary, talk loud but ain't really

Your girl with me, you really married, damn I'm fucking your marriage  
  
On the real these rappers pussy, nah really, straight up  
But meanwhile I'm in my traphouse, with 'bout six different flavors  
But fuck that, let's get to it  
Took out my scale, broke down the bale, and my clientele ran straight through

Drinking mud, riding through the city, yup  
Selling pea's out the coupe really, yup  
Paid fifteen K for my S.S. and invested another fifty, yup  
These rap niggas they don't wanna see me, nah  
Guess a bitch with me taking off her draws'  
Smoking weed and laughing, burning rubber while I'm running from the law  
Really, fuck you nigga come get me  
I'm a Cashtank nigga and all we do is get money, you feel me?  
Know there's two Glock's with me, yup  
Got that boy Guwop with me, yup  
Downtown rooftop chilling, yup  
Quarter mill' on the floor, really  
  
My young niggas, they really ready  
Straps cocked, are ready  
These rap niggas are really scary, talk loud but ain't really  
We tote choppers like military, niggas gotta get passed us  
Your girl with me, you really married, damn I'm fucking your marriage  
  
Nigga I'm bickin' back and I'm boolin'  
Drop the top, and then foolish  
Finessing game with your main bitch, now my pockets is stupid  
Fuck with Gucci, get you an issue  
You pussy soft, like tissue  
Hundred K'll get you knocked out  
Put me in the ring, get boxed out  
So I jump on the stage, get the team real hype  
Gucci throw a cup and the whole squad fight  
Bottles on me, so we pouring all night  
Nigga get a trippy ? night  
I'm jumping out that coupe, I lost my damn roof  
Thank god that boy so fly, we don't need no parachute  
So I'm chasing after fix, squeezing on these triggers  
Bank account six figures, kick my feet up, Louie slippers  
Vacation in the Hampton's, rockstar Marilyn Manson  
All for that check, I hold a nigga ransom  
  
My young niggas, they really ready  
Straps cocked, are ready  
These rap niggas are really scary, talk loud but ain't really  
We tote choppers like military, niggas gotta get passed us  
Your girl with me, you really married, damn I'm fucking your marriage

I ain't neva seen a nigga like me where he at where he from I'd like to meet

I'm a rolling stone cookin' with the rolly on 32 shots in my nina  
I'm a rolling stone got my rolly pollie on fuck it not Kafima and Katrina  
Shots of gas bags in the beamer  
Pussy bald head like leukemia  
Watch me set it off like Khadijah  
Stuffing my cigar with the diesel  
Pull up jump off with the Keisha  
See you out dea' I need my money-fa  
Puerto Rican don't need a visa  
Dope white name Mona Lisa  
Frank white head shot Tito  
Longway not Carlito  
Boot up off the molly I don't fuck with the easy hoes  
Porsche 9-1-1 got it out the repo  
Trap house naw bitch I'm trappin' rollin stizzle  
Gas bags I got them bitches going for the lizzo  
Fake shot glass and have them J's at the dizzo  
I'm runnin them I'm a mob boss calling me Sunny  
I'm connected with the pharm-ist got them pints by the hundreds  
Whole lot of C notes rubberbandin' my hunnits  
Still makin drug deals out the trunk of my Honda  
Leanin of a double seal like I'm dumber than dumber  
Rollin off a molly pill tryna fuck on your mama

[Verse 2: Peewee Longway]  
I'm servin you Xanax to lean the neighborhood pharm-ist I'll serve you coedine  
My bitch she servin up P's and buy different bags then go by Saline  
She speak different languages but she Portuguese  
She drop in the fishes then whip it up in grease  
My trap house but her name on the lease  
We might get married like Nas and Kelis  
My bad I'm trippin' I'm back on my G  
Mad black the forgies and srt8 the jeep  
Just got an endorsement from servin' the lean  
Thanks to extortion I'm cleaning the streets  
Double are Royces I roll them in fleets  
My trap house stay rollin' I'm never off beat  
I'm baggin up pounds to a new C Note beat  
Trapper and rapper still strapped with them hammer  
(I make the dope dance like I'm mc Hammer [x2])  
Chopin' up pharmists I'm servin you the grammar  
And lean I get it from over the counter  
Chopin' up pharmists with cameras like Tony Montana  
And choppas with clips like bananas  
  
[Chorus x2]
