Dear anne my number one fan  
I write with the life of the lamp on my night stand  
With a pen in my right hand and that's also my mic hand  
Codeine in the sprite can ink on my white pad  
I'm thinking of life and wrong and right and  
Sometimes I'm right and sometimes I might  
I cannot find the light still my rhymes are bright  
So I continue my plan and I'm shore like white sand  
That there will be price paid before my flight landed  
But still I want to see more than my sight can

And now y'all know I'm the yee-yo muscle, man  
But on the under, I got that wonder, to stop that thunder  
That rumble in the side of ya stomach, piled on water  
How do you want it, come through in a Coupe powder blue or  
High with water, how do you want it man  
Hey, I towed a lot of tullies dun, I den broke a lot of hoopties dun

I'd rather count a hundred thousand dollars on a Sunday  
Watch a football game and bet it all on one play  
Still stuntin' baby yes I'm still flossin'  
Latest car on the market with the top peeled off it  
Big wheels make it look a lil' bulky  
You look a lil' salty have ya-self a chill coffee  
Chill out, the girls is still out  
Even though I am a boss and got papers to fill out  
I'm busy I got people to reel in  
God I hope they snappin' at the end of my rod  
I hope I'm fishin' in the right pond  
And I hope you catch on to every line  
Who a I!

I'm cold like a midnight in Aspen  
I am the president and the assassin  
Cameras, on big lights, action  
Welcome to the show, I am the main attraction  
Money in the mattress, money in the attic  
Money on my mind, money is my habit  
Stay on the grind until the money's automatic  
Bitch I love money I'm a fucking fanatic  
All day strapped grip tight, grasping  
Say what? Who me? Click-Clack, blast 'em  
Chrome 24's tires thin like napkins  
Gotta ride big cause I am like a captain  
You know I'm a boss, chillin', relaxin'  
Probably in my office, doin' my taxes  
You little niggas so not in my bracket,  
And I don't even have time to practice  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I got ice, ridiculous price  
Your camera has never saw a picture this nice (Hmm)  
I'm fishin' and the bitches will bite  
It's prolly cause my game is fixin' in tight, Right  
I'm fuckin' every bad bitch twice  
And if she doesn't wear panties then I'll fuck her on sight  
I'm nasty like spice  
I know what she likes  
I can make a black women scream like she white  
I can make a white women scream like Mike  
But before she start singin', she gotta check my Mic  
Niggas just hatin'  
And I dun lost sight  
It's like i don't see 'em I only see the night  
You talkin' that shit but you boys just hype  
I hope you bring a gun to the fight Aight?  
Louis V tennis shoes, big brown stripe  
You think you fresh, Nigga I'm ripe  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Brand new coupe, drivin' crazy then the mother's  
Sittin' low in the seats with the burner sittin' under  
Got my tank top toppe on it  
Prolly ain't summer  
But I ride like that cause I'm hotter than the others  
Damn, there's no keepin' up with the brother man  
I can spell my name in burnt rubber  
I'm gone  
Leave me alone  
Now the dog is at supper  
You can wash my plate an put it back in the cupboard  
I'm so far ahead of them suckers  
I'm gonna have to start rappin' in numbers  
I promise the flows don't stop they come rappin' like thunder  
I bet you hide under your covers haha  
  
[Chorus]

Brand new money, Brand new boston  
You act brand new, And get a brand new coffin  
Little bro, I gotcha, hold ya weight and ima spot cha

We have them bitches like it was unplugged  
Its Weezy wee, Mannie fresh, and unplugged  
We have them bitches like it was unplugged  
Weezy, fresh, and unplugged  
  
[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]  
Give me a big fine bitch in a dress  
One put them lips in effect  
Suck the dick 'til the shit in her chest  
You can piss on her breast  
I like that shit  
Project hoes like that dick, don't bite that dick  
Give me a spanish sweet hoe  
Black from Puerto Rico  
Freak ho, specialize in givin' me deep throat  
Really don't care how short how plump, short or thick  
Give me head, don't care, swallow cum don't spit  
Aww shit, I like them Jamaicans and them Haitians  
Niggas can't take it when they shake an make me rape 'em  
White girl's I video tape 'em and they enjoy it  
They love it when everybody saw it  
Its off the chain  
High yellow Mexican bitches they all for brain  
But watch them hoes who want the change  
Its not a game  
Or short Cuban hoe, with a fat ass though  
An I'll keep the bitch just like Fidel Castro  
  
[Chorus: Unplugged]  
Tell me what you like  
Let me tell you what I like  
You goin' on an breakin' me off by the end of the night  
You can ride with me  
Cause I like ya simmon's jeans  
Ain't tryin' to make a love scene  
Truly I just want you to break me off  
  
[Verse 2: Lil wanye]  
Weezy the hottest  
Drinkin' barcadi  
I stream through the scene on a lincon on robbers  
Lookin' for the finest dime, to wine and dine  
Later on I'm tryin' to climb behind ya spine  
Hold up lil mama, slow ya ass down  
Pick it up, throw ya ass down  
Now throw ya ass around  
An scream me name  
I can't hear you say it louder what (wayne, wayne)  
A damn shame  
Better watch that boy he nasty  
I strap on a plastic  
Break ya off like elastic  
Put the dick in the middle, make it wiggle for ya'll  
Might be small, but that dick ain't little at all  
I like a short thick broad, fat ass an shit  
Like taso flip like Trina the baddest bitch  
Matter of fact when I see her, pull her over like a cop  
Juve could of backed it up an I would of dropped it like its hot  
Ha ha, ya heard me  
Ha ha, unplugged  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Verse 3: Mannie Fresh]  
I like them big, round, yellow and brown  
A bitch that take it from the back and make the (ugh ugh) sound  
Now you can bounce, slide, drop, giddy up, giddy up  
Now you can ride til you feel it hit a nut, hit a nut  
Bounce for ya hood, shake for ya baby daddy  
Twerk for that nigga who got you pregnant in the caddy  
Slide with the ky, hold up ?  
My bitch got thong, you bitch got drawls  
My chick like to swallow, yo chick like to spit  
If yo chick was my chick I'd still love that bitch  
Hold up, chill out, wait a minute stop  
My ginseng, Viagra, and a strawberry pop  
See I'm feelin' kinda bold, why don't ya bring a friend  
From vagina to the asshole do it again  
I want a yucky down misses bout whatever  
Yo mama loved a tymer, now you welcome  
You OK lil mama and I love that chick  
But deep down inside I just love me dick  
  
[Chorus: x4]

(feat. Little Brother)  
  
Hey baby look here, I got this new song I wrote, it's got that nice slow
groove that everybody dancin' to, and when I play it, it kinda remind me of me
and you. I mean, there's one more thing I want to talk about. It's time for
you to come home, everybody got their problems I'm dealing with mine. I done
gave up them narcotics, I'm a changed man.  
  
[Bridge:]  
She loves me, she loves me not.  
  
[Verse 1: Little Brother]  
How many ways can I say I'm done fishin'.  
You wanted the role, smash the audition.  
Havin' a partner for a man in my position eliminates the cooks in the kitchen.  
Still I got a taste for that fast food, foreign cars, many women.  
And some say it's the life I was given.  
I say it don't matter if I work at Mc-E-D's.  
I still got a fix for what you got between ya knees.  
On a new broad, you still one to one.  
Every once in again I like havin' some fun.  
No disrespect intended but what's done is done.  
Women steppin' out for love, men do what to come.  
Not a playa like Pun, but when shorties get the grabbin' on me.  
The last thought I get is Koobie run.  
To them girls wishin' on a star that's will stun.  
But I gotta tell it like it is hun, one.  
  
[Chorus x2: Lil Brother First, Lil Wayne Second]  
She say she love me, won't leave me, won't ever let me go.  
But if you're thinkin' of leaving you need to let me know.  
We better together then further apart, so darlin' don't go breakin' my heart.  
  
[Verse 2: Lil Brother]  
We was high school sweethearts, talkin' since we was teens.  
Every morning, and every evening.  
Ten years later she eatin' that mean cuisine.  
I'm on the field, straight gone of that creatine.  
In the nfl which mean Not For Long.  
City to city, all the groupies they hop along.  
Word get back to wifey, she like So you made it, this far,  
We upstairs, I let you up here  
You special, Marley, don't shoot  
You know what this is?  
Still The Carter 2 people  
Still The Carter 2 people  
Yeah, you still in the carter 2 people  
  
Hey yeah,  
All I have in this world is a pistol and a promise  
A fist full of dollars, a list full of problems  
I'll address them like P.O. Boxes  
Yeah I'm from New Orleans, the Creole cockpit  
We so out of it, zero tolerance  
Gangster gumbo, I'll serve 'em a pot of it  
I'm wealthy, still fuckin' with that block shit  
Wet your ass up, head to feet till your sock a drip  
Don't slip, you might fall and bust your ass  
No snakes at the carter, tell the gardener to cut the grass  
I hear 'em but they talking under mass  
Stop throwing pebbles at a bulletproof glass  
That's Cash Money, honey pie  
We ain't runnin', we don't hide screamin' fuck the other side  
Don't get caught on it, this the dailiest grind  
I'll put your heart on it and walk on it  
The chalks only for the art homie  
How they trace ya after I erase ya  
Look around, we at war and you still in preparation  
I'm riding for them reparations, no patience  
Slow paper is better than no paper  
Fast money don't last too long, you gotta pace it  
You gotta know that paper  
If you got it from a caper, you gotta blow that paper  
Gotta know that photo-fobia, no Kodak moments  
Feds walls with my pictures on 'em  
Nah, I ain't even in the school yearbook  
I don't do too much posin', got a cool killer look  
Career crook, get your career took  
I'm back like a brassiere hook  
Bitch cheer, camouflage gear, the hunter's here  
Better play it by ear, you ain't nothing but a deer  
Around here and this here is The Carter  
Serve it while it's hot out the pot to your mama  
And Slim tell me ain't nobody hotter  
But get your boys some different sauce, I want the whole enchilada  
I got 'em by the collar, watch me drop 'em  
On the head at the bottom  
You ain't gotta shoot 'em cause I already shot 'em  
And I ain't gotta get 'em cause I already got 'em  
Get 'em

Fuck wrong with these sissy niggas'  
I'm smoking that Bill Bixby nigga  
I'm spendin money, spendin money  
Ben Franklin dizzy nigga!  
Your bitch on my dick, I told her I was busy  
She say 'Wayne on me, Wayne on me' cause yo ass need drizzlin  
That pussy came gift-wrapped, bow and a ribbon  
And if she bounce that ass then I'm dribblin  
That pussy so wet, it turned into a Gremlin  
There's only one me, ain't no equivalent  
She give me brain, brain like trivia  
I got a black bitch and a red bitch  
I call them hoes Aunt Vivian  
Chopper knock your face off  
Black shades, Ray Charles  
I be killing young hoes  
I got your ho up in my graveyard  
I ain't working with a full deck  
But I pull out that Ace card  
She grab that dick with 2 hands  
Like she about to pray for it  
Clips hanging, no curfew  
Fuck you and who birthed you  
I'm shining like church shoes  
Birdman Jr., y'all birdfood  
I'm bout it.. I said I'm about to cum  
She opened her mouth, water fountain  
When I'm on the scene I'm on that lean  
Bitch, I'm drowsy  
Man, I'm so high I don't know what I'm laughing about  
I got bars, nigga  
And it's happy hour!  
  
Riding round with them choppas, not them ninas  
Riding around with a bitch named Molly and she on Molly ' ha!  
Bitch I put my foot in your ass, karate  
Man these niggas can't see me like a diary  
Smoke that weed, let's get irie  
Nigga shut up, that bitch got a silencer  
Top of the gun there is a scope  
I close one eye, I look like a pirate, fuck it!  
Truckfit my bitch up, Tunechi leave big nuts  
I'm getting my dick sucked  
I blow weed like it's dust!  
Spacehead, love pussy, hate feds  
Just bought my girl a Ferrari Spider  
Told her drive it like it got 8 legs  
I'm a made nigga, Machiavelli  
That Mack-11 necessary  
I'm a hard head, I pop the cherry  
No pussy no rats, no Tom and Jerry  
They say your friends are your enemies'  
Well, my friends are imaginary  
I'm the motherfuckin resolution like the 1st of January  
My ride cold and my bitch hot  
I'm tired as hell but my dick not  
I don't gas no bitch, no pitstop  
Smoke Barney and Baby Bop!  
Y'all niggas act like lady cops  
My niggas smoke like coffee shops  
That's syrup gang, wafflehouse  
Gunfight, I'll knock you out  
My bitch titties is poppin out  
We poppin up and we get it poppin  
Mask on, gloves on  
Like Mickey Mouse, clips stickin out  
Like Nicki's ass  
Smoking on that sticky bag  
Weezy F, I'm big and bad  
Small feet, but I kick your ass  
I'm the trigger man, that shooting star  
Eat that pussy like caviar  
She treat that dick just like a straw  
How you like them apples, Microsoft'  
Now wipe it off,  
I do Liv on Sundays, church!  
Step off in that motherfucker fresher than some Certs  
Uuh! Who the fuck is Stevie J'  
I got the ball, playing keepaway  
Kidnap your ass, kill your ass  
Then hide your ass like an Easter Egg!  
It's Hollygrove to my deathbed  
Just make sure my pillow's fluffed  
Hit a nigga with a million shots  
What you call that' A million bucks  
Good weed, we pass around  
Money talks, mine got a nasty mouth  
It's Young Money, Cash Money  
Til the motherfuckin' day I'm Cashin Out!

[Intro]  
I'm sorry for the wait, I'm sorry for the wait  
Tha Carter gon' be late so I cooked up a tape  
The garden's full of snakes so I had to escape  
Lil homie gon' be straight, lil' homie gon' be straight  
  
[Hook]  
This that Sorry 4 The Wait 2  
And I'm sorry for the wait too  
I told myself to save yourself cause I can't save you  
I send my goons to kill somebody, I need head proof  
Fuck, this that Sorry 4 The Wait 2  
I ain't trippin', I got Barbie, I got Drake too  
I send my goons to kill somebody, I need head proof  
Then they come through and sit it on my coffee table  
  
[Verse 1]  
Who kept this shit together? Nigga, me, that's who  
Who was there when niggas left? Nigga, me, that's who  
Cash Money is an army, I'm a one man army  
And if them niggas comin' for me, I'm goin' out like Tony  
Now I don't want no problems, I just want my money  
Ain't gotta hold no conversation or my luggage  
Tell whoever's countin' that I'm on a hundred  
Birdman Jr., more like Ugly Duckling  
  
[Bridge]  
Takin' over, now I'm takin' over  
Think it's over? Bitch I'm thinkin' forward  
I'm sippin' lean out a glass, nigga  
All I got is Young Money, no more Cash, nigga  
  
[Hook]  
And this that Sorry 4 The Wait 2  
No longer am I my brother's keeper, Cain and Abel  
Young Money sharp, I'm still eatin', I just chipped my tooth  
Tell them niggas no love lost cause I ain't got shit to lose  
I told myself to save yourself cause I can't save you  
I send my goons to kill somebody, I need head proof  
I found a needle in a haystack, put the thread through  
I tried to stitch the wound back up but I just bled through  
  
[Verse 2]  
It's compensation over conversation  
Lord I must got blurry vision, a nigga's got two faces  
Lord, this game is a vampire  
But you gotta protect your neck, it'll suck you dry like raisins, lord  
But fuck that, nigga  
Gun drawn out, fuck that, nigga, I'ma ball out  
The day you met me is when Hell froze  
On the day I left is when it thawed out  
I'm still in the buildin', I just have to knock a couple walls down  
Have to kick y'all out  
Life is a movie but sometimes a nigga get too tired of watchin' and walk out  
  
[Bridge]  
Takin' over, now I'm takin' over  
Dropped the Sorry 4 The Wait until the wait is over  
Sippin' lean out a flask, nigga  
And all I do is smoke, fuckin' thrash, nigga  
  
[Hook]  
And this the Sorry 4 The Wait 2  
Fuck these haters, throw your board up if you skate too  
I send my goons to kill somebody, I need head proof  
Then they come through and sit it on my coffee table  
Tunechi, niggas don't appreciate you  
You've been down since day 1, it meant nothin' on take 2  
Sometimes the truth is hard to swallow and to say too  
But I graduated from that bullshit, now I hate school  
  
[Outro]  
And now I'm takin' over, now I'm takin' over  
Old me dead and gone, that's who I'm prayin' over  
Might have to go back to slangin' yola 'til the wait is over  
If so then I got bakin' soda, I got bakin' soda

Microphone check 12 or just 1-2  
I am me who are fuck you  
And I'm 1-2 high you should look up to me  
My french girls love it when we smoke the oo oui.  
En belle au france I do when we smoke the ooey  
I do me she feels me cummin like new teeth  
I got paper like loose leaf  
Come over here and maybe you can get a few sheets  
My bodies unique like the sistine chapel  
Fresh (fresh) 6 spring apples  
I should cut myself to see if my bloods red  
Baby I brainstorm call me flood head  
Married to the money  
And if she leaves me bury me money  
And when your not good then your arrogance is funny  
And when your really rich then asparagus is yummy

Uh huh  
Mario  
And Young Weezy baby (Oh)  
So you know that only means one thing  
This the remix baby

Because it's you that I really want  
And we can do what you really want  
Girl we grown and if he ain't gon treat you right  
Then I ain't gon treat you wrong  
That's my word  
And she done heard so many lies  
She don't what's true or not  
Shawty like a valley servers  
I swear she been through a lot  
But I put her car in park  
And never let her cry alone  
I listen to her heart beat  
Because it plays my favorite song  
  
(Chrous)  
I can hear your heart crying out for me (crying out for me)  
I can hear your heart crying out for me  
(And it keeps on saying) Come on in, come on in come on in and save me  
(And it keeps on saying) Come on in, come on in come on in and save me  
(I can baby) I can hear your heart crying out for me  
  
[Verse 2:]-Mario  
Baby, I should've never caught no feelings  
But baby having late night conversion on your sofa  
You telling me how he played you out over and over, over and over  
But I'm stuck in the middle of seeing you hurt  
I know when you love him  
And you wanna make it work  
And I can't help but think that I knew you first  
It's getting louder  
Girl I can't ignore it no more baby  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
I don't wanna confuse things (no)  
But I just can't keep lying to myself  
When you're holding me (when you're holding me)  
I can feel your pain oh baby let me be your dream  
I'm the answer come see me (see me)  
And you don't have to cry no more (you don't have to cry)  
  
Girl I can hear your heart baby  
I can hear your heart  
Girl it's crying  
Won't you listen to your heart, baby  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Girl I can hear, hear it cry for me, for me, for me, me, me, me(whoo)  
  
Ladies wave your hands in the air  
Ladies wave your hands in the air  
  
Oh oh baby  
It's crying for me  
It's crying for me for me

I ain't nervous, I swear to God I ain't nervous, no no  
And I'm laughing at them pussy niggas and that pussy shit they doin'  
I'm getting cake like I'm Jewish, my nigga Drake he Jewish  
I swear to god I ain't nervous, okay I swear to god I ain't nervous  
I swear to god I ain't nervous, I say, I swear to god I ain't nervous, no  
I got her workin' twerkin' and slurping my serpent  
Ain't got no problems in this bitch, for certain  
I see you turnin' up but your turn up ain't workin'  
Just want some mouth and lip service  
And I got all my niggas in that truck like an Excursion  
  
Okay I'm straight at you, no ricochet  
That pussy boneless, that's Chick-fil-a

And this pistol came with a silence

Yeah  
  
Money ain't shit, bitches ain't neither  
You know I'm on that grass, don't cut on the sprinklers  
Pussy on my mind, on my breath and on my fingers  
Niggas try to bite my style, but my style a jalapeno  
I got skinny ass jeans, trucks on the pocket  
Money talks, nigga, I'm caught up in that gossip  
You know all my bitches badder, and all my swishas fatter  
I milk this shit like cattle, that's my word like Scrabble  
And yo main girl is a ho, I go Wayne's World in her throat  
She swallow so many nuts, you fuck around, find a squirrel in her throat  
I go tape worm in that ho, let my snake squirm in that ho  
Nigga we take turns in that ho, these niggas so green they glow  
I am the best thing since wet pussy, on my private jet with my chef cookin'  
So big headed my neck crooked, my niggas foul when the ref's lookin'  
My big bro is Mack Maine, so much weed I got grass stains  
Deez nuts, that's baggage claim, I'm on them trees like Candy Canes  
Lil Tunechi  
  
Yeah, 2 Chainz  
I might book me for a show  
Charge my ass the low and pick up the whole dough  
That's hustlenomics, I was high in my class pictures  
I like math, all I did was add bitches  
Swagga galore, got your girl on all fours  
It's not doggy style, I call it froggystyle  
You dog her out, I tell her, hop in  
2 Chainz, my first chain had a twin  
Gas in my blunt, watching ESPN  
And, if that pussy good I wanna see her again  
Yeah, I'm from College Park and I got ya broad with me  
Salt water pool, I can put a shark in it  
Everything authentic, plus I named my pistols  
Last name Fuck, first name I Don't Give A  
Pockets look pregnant, they 'bout to deliver  
So when I start dippin' you know the procedure  
  
You leave your home for days and days  
  
All my niggas gangstas, all my bitches freaks  
I tickle her pussy, got that pussy tickle pink  
I'm the heart of the streets, and I just skipped a beat  
And if that pussy sweet, I want that candy, trick or treat  
I got diamonds in my teeth, so all my words are precious  
I'm so fuckin' hot I sssssss I'ma need some more S's  
Man I'm on some other shit, I want another bitch  
That want another bitch, and I don't cuddle bitch  
I hit her with that shovel dick, I got in that pussy and dug a ditch  
Some people gotta punch the clock, man I rather punch a brick  
'Cause I'm that nigga, and I'm so cold I just shivered  
These niggas think they hard, these niggas just nipples  
I pop a nigga like a 'sicle, drop a nigga like a missile  
Mo' money mo' issues, I size you up then fit you  
Tunechi  
  
You leave your home for days and days

Dont Stop, Wont Stop(Speak to them Jazze)  
  
[Chorus]  
I

I'm way more fly than you  
(That's right)  
I'll take your dime from you  
(That's right)  
Now she want to spend all night with me  
(She want to wake up with Weezy-F baby)  
Let me be the one that you throw it to, baby  
(Throw it back ma, throw it back, throw it back, throw it back ma)  
I'd like to spend the rest of my night with you  
(Yea so how bout you, so how bout you)  
  
I'll take your bitch give her back, take your bitch again  
Because you throw a five I pitch a ten  
Now she want to get inside of my sixty six  
She sees my wrist blue and yellow like Michigan  
She say she love her man she misses him  
But nobody do it better than her distance dick (me)  
I'm her long distance pimp  
When I land my bitches want for me on the strip (yup)  
And I don't lie I confess,  
I'm the one who turn that orange vest to a dress  
Gotta dress to impress though,  
Gotta stay clean, plus momma in a Lex four  
She with me, what you expect, I live to be fly to death  
It's the bird man Jr. sincerely yours  
When it rains it pours, when it rains it whores  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Now why you want to go do that  
Like I can't see through that  
Tattoo right there like I can't view that  
Girl what that say, Girl what who that  
Bet he was lame, bet he ain't Lil' Wayne (nop)  
Cause I'm way more flyer  
Have you hanging round a bunch of yeyo buyers (no),(no)  
And not a day go by us,  
We don't get higher than the telephone wires  
Cut your telephone off we ridin'  
Where phones don't roam they don't even come on  
You're far from home so leave it alone  
You creeping with the king of the throne  
You sleepin' in a tee and a thong  
With your hair in a pony  
I ain't got no blinds  
We can stare at the morning (yup)  
But I can't be there all morning  
I'm a pimp, baby girl, I'm going, going, gone  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm sorry I was grooving  
Gotta love that laid back Mannie Fresh music  
But let's get back to what we was doing  
Laid back in that black on Pat Ewing's  
That's thirty three V tires, he fire  
These streets ain't papaya ma  
You gotta keep heat on your side  
Two must, so I'm a get three more and cop you one  
Wait, naw hun cause you ain't exempt  
If your ass ever trip I'll give you a clip (yea)  
But I love the way your jeans suck in your hip  
And you walk kinda mean how you strut with a dip  
And you talk kinda clean and you lick your lips  
But I can't fall for you cause I stick to the script (yup)  
I said I stick to my grip,  
I stick to my money,  
That's life to me  
Sorry honey Jazze  
  
[Chorus]  
  
So how bout you, yea  
So how bout you?  
See what I'm talking bout sweet heart  
You ain't even gotta have John Madden  
You ain't gotta have Dick Vitale,  
You ain't gotta Lee Carsole  
You ain't gotta have Stuart Scott,  
You ain't gotta have Linda Cohn  
Know what I'm talking bout,  
You ain't gotta have the staff of E-S-P-N  
You ain't gotta have ABC staff just to talk sports baby  
Cause I got game sweetheart  
Just fuck with the boy and I'll get you a jersey  
What you want me to put on the back  
Daddy's little that's right,  
See what I'm talking bout  
I can't give you the game  
But I can show the game  
And you can see what you see  
And peek how you peek and get what you get  
Know what I'm talking bout  
Weezy

Of the deads forehead I killed the father  
Spilled the heart of a mildew hater  
I will put them body on chill like glaciers  
Gracias I'm crazy yes it's obvious  
Going against me is atheist  
I got my angels on my shoulders and a quarter of that angel dust  
I ain't sniffin' I'm just pitchin' ya honor I ain't snitchin' ya honor  
Hate bitch niggas bitches with power  
Vacate when the kitchen get hotter  
I just sit on the counter open the cabinet close the cupboard  
Put that jar in the skillet drop a four in the bubbles  
I remember being young tryin' to hustle my dough  
Tryin' to tell the old junkies that my crack ain't soap  
Tryin' to tell you fool you chump that my mack ain't broke  
You ain't tryin' to see how far that black back lane go  
No, call me Pacman you ghosts is blue  
I got my red river rubies and my oceans blue  
Jewelry, usually I'm a hooligan for the money  
Yeah I'm eatin' but I got a tapeworm in my tummy oh  
Make harm in the bomb you in public  
Hit you with the straight arm no warning nothin'  
Look it's mornin' no yawnin' or nothin'  
I ain't sleepin' I'm up tryin' to take a nigga lunch  
You gon make a nigga break a nigga fronts  
Then shake a nigga shorts and we takin' what we want  
I'm so 5-0-4 you got to kill me here  
If you ever lookin' for me bitch I will be here  
Cash Money is an army Navy Seal me here  
Lot of niggas ran from it but I'll still be here  
No chrome on the continental I'm so fundamental  
Crack the phill' crack the roof and roll up the window  
And my hood love me they tell me bring it home  
That's why I holla Hollygrove on each and every song  
You leapin' at a dog a dog wit no bark  
Just a bite like an old shark  
And all you bitch niggas no paw  
I'm talkin' bout stunna  
He like keep ya door he got ya whole winters  
Sunshine's on the king and sets on the prince  
I met the Birdman and I been shinin' ever since like that (that, that, that)

The back of Tha Carter  
The back of Tha Carter, two, oh  
Yea, this here is, the end of Tha Carter Two people  
Hey! Yea  
  
I got the game on ball and chain  
I threw the key in the drain  
I'm like the key in the drought  
I spent a G on these frames, though my vision is priceless  
Seeing through you niggas like a fucking psychic  
Hearing through the grapevine, niggas wanna hate mine  
Say my name and die in the daytime  
You catch my drift, man you better be Peyton  
Boy the heats on, they make a peace bond  
I'm in this bitch, throwing up the seventeenth sign  
Straight frowns, no daps, strapped three times  
That Tec-eleven, A-K forty seven, one Beretta, ready for whatever  
Tell them pussy niggas come together  
Happy better nigga, nigga super soaker wetter nigga  
Six feet under flowers, you ain't nothing but a petal nigga  
I'm just a little nigga, trying to be a civil nigga  
Thirty years old, shit that'll be a giving nigga  
Quit it Wayne, your Mom is listening  
But she ain't really trippin', 'cause the pots is pissed in  
Them niggas tripping, until the shots whistling'  
Hear them bullets sizzle, like a cobra at attention  
I gotta bitch, and quit calling women bitches  
As long as she don't worry 'bout the coke in the kitchen  
No preventing the grind, I gotta get it  
I'm admitted to the game, true playa, no quitting  
There you go shitting on a way a nigga thanking  
Only history I know is Benjamin Franklin  
This is the future ain't promised to no one  
I live everyday like this is the sure one  
Train in the tidal wave, this is the ocean  
Stand in the heat, 'til the mother fucking snow come  
And it feels so fucking good  
Throw my dope like a rope, let them tug and pull  
No hope for the hopeless, rats and roaches  
Running cross the porch, in the attic there's a fortune  
Come and get it, automatics in motion  
We banging for the bread nigga, even the molded  
I got my loaf, I got my toast  
Chaperon of the south, I got my coast, yea  
And until I die I'm the, the, the, the, the best rapper alive

The fam at the table got a full course dinner  
Young money cash money throw pifatti at the winner

Cause gangstas talk one word will be a wall  
Alone with two can't handle this destructin  
All body killin baby sound like seductin

That's real nigga talk, these niggas speechless  
Cut off his arm and leg like I charge for my features  
Hammer on my side like I work in construction  
Your bitch hit that head so hard we get concussions  
Niggas can't see me, not even a glimpse  
Too many banana clips, I feel like chimps  
South beach bitch and I tan line stupid  
You could find me on collins like bootsy  
I ain't on no fuck shit, I be on that truk fit  
Your girl do tongue tricks and you sweeter than one six

With her attractive ass,  
You get her the matching bags,  
I get her to pack them bags,  
Get straight in that taxi cab,  
Come straight to my bachelor pad,  
I hate to see her go,  
But I love to watch her leave,  
I keep her comin' back,  
Like she forgot her keys,  
And now we're murderers,  
Because we kill time,  
She saw doctor carter and now she feel fine,  
  
[Gudda Gudda]  
I like the way you walking if you walking my way,

I'll let you be the judge,  
And and I'm the case,

Look, look at you (at you)

[Nicki Minaj]  
Ok I get it, let me think,

Maybe it's time to put this p-ssy on your sideburns,  
You say I'm bad, you probably right,  
He pressing me like button downs on a friday night,  
I'm so pretty like, be on my pedal bike,  
Be on my low scrunch,  
Be on my egg and whites,  
You say Nicki don't stop you the bestest,  
And I just be coming off the top asbestos,  
  
[Drake]  
I love your sushi roll,  
Hotter than Wasabi,  
I race for your love,  
Shake and bake ricky bobby,  
I'm at the W but I can't meet you at the lobby,  
Girl I gotta watch my back cos I'm not just anybody,  
I see em stand in line just to get beside her,  
I let her see the Aston, and let the rest surprise her,  
Cos when we disappear, you need gps to find her,  
Oh that was you girl,  
I thought I recognised her,  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
[Tyga]  
She like tanning,  
I like staying in,  
She like romancing,  
I like rollin with friends,  
She said I'm caged in,  
I think her conscious is,  
She watching them dat oxygen,  
I'm watching espn,  
But when the shows ends she all in my skin,  
Lotions, no emotions, rollarcoasting like back forth,  
Hold it (hold it, hold it, hold it)  
She pose like it's for posters,  
And I poke like I'm supposed to,  
Take this photo if you for me,  
Don't you ever show this,  
I'm too loyal, and too focused  
To be losing and be hopeless,  
When I spoke this she rejoiced it,  
Tell your words, get me open,  
So I closed it, where your clothes is?  
I'm only lovin for the moment.  
  
[Jae Millz]  
She aint got a man, but she is not alone,  
Miss Independent, yeah she got her own,  
Hey gorgeous uh I mean flawless,  
Well that's what you are, how I see it,

[J. Cole]  
When this shit drop, I was like 16  
Tryna get some head from a mixed thing  
Big dreams, say about some ripped jeans  
Nigga got a job, have my little?  
Worst fear is getting robbed for my last 50 dollars that I had left over  
5 dollars in they pocket, nigga in his left shoulder  
Minimum wage 5.15. 132s on the whip  
Kept my shit clean  
Actually that was my momma shit  
But I'm driving round town on my Obama shit  
Middle class my ass, just to get a tank of gas  
Had to run the guns up the street and pawn the shit  
But, yeah I'm headed for a scholarship  
Little scrap game but I got a lot of lip  
That's why them niggas don't like me and always wanna fight me  
A dumb nigga hate a smart mouth most likely  
I know the game I'm an expert  
Nigga, how you gonna jump me if my legs work?  
Nigga I'm gone, showed up at the crib tryna bone  
And I aint fuck yet cause her momma always home  
God damn, Lor-Lord have Mercy  
Please God don't let this little broad have herpes  
My nigga says she fast like Jackie Joyner-Kersee  
Gold medals if we gave hoes?  
No rose petals on a bed in the ghettos  
Spiderman sheets got us singing falsetto  
Tall white tee's, can't believe we used to wear those  
White folks looking at us like we're weirdos  
But we was only kiddo's  
Grabbing titties in the club, pocket full of skittles  
Tryna get the kitty was like tryna solve a riddle  
Tryna get the Diddy, cause I murder instrumentals  
It's that good old fashioned Mark Jackson  
Fucked then I'll pass, y'all Utah Jazz  
And ya'll borin', I don't play nigga I'm Mark Madsen  
That's why my knots thick like a fucking Kardashian  
I'm not asking my nigga I don't need favours  
I'm in the streets with the fiends, I done seen danger  
My team major, we party like teenagers  
I'm in the green Range, nigga I'm the green ranger  
(I fucking ran out of breath)  
Team major, we party like teenagers  
I'm in the green Range, nigga I'm the green ranger

Drop ya body off at a cops house

Haha, you a dyke cause your man a pussy  
Hit you from the blindside no Sandra Bullock  
Never bite the hand that feeds you, always watch the hand that's cooking  
Tunechi, D4 Hoe  
Shout out Cole  
You already know what it is, Cole World  
Wayne's World  
We in this bitch hoe  
Special delivery at your front door

Back the hell off  
Rock 'n' roll Jesus with all my nails on  
All I need is a blunt and a bail bond  
And give these blind motherfuckers something to feel on  
Rollin' like a motherfucker put your wheels on  
And lets roll down and heal till the heal gone  
I started on the block but that something to build on  
And how can I pray when I got nothing to kneel on  
  
Hey  
The ground is gone  
Don't look now but the ground is gone  
I'm so high that the ground is gone  
And I don't even know which cloud I'm on  
Don't look down but the ground is gone  
Don't look down cause the ground is gone  
Right now I'm a million miles from home  
And I'm so high that the ground is gone  
  
Walk on air,

Say my name baby pull my hair,  
and I'm a fuck you like a bull I swear  
I gotta lot of love that I could just share  
I gotta lot of drugs that I could just share!  
I know I know where should I go,  
a nice lil' mirror and a little white girl  
Way at the top of the mountain, bouncing.  
May I be everything but grounded!  
I don't ever wanna see the bottom the bottom  
I just wanna float, float like Muhammad.  
I don't ever wanna see the bottom the bottom  
I just wanna float

I look into her eyes and I can see it all  
I see it when she cry, I'm there when she call

Kill 'em all, die in the spirit of the war  
Thinkin' would a mind be in spiritual for

Then watch the goverment take that money  
But we gon' raise hell, motherfucker get well  
Laws get passed and economies fail  
Love, hate, emotion, compulsion, addiction, fiction,virgins

Sweets, freaks, faggots, flame, fashion, planes crashing

Dawg you gotta feel me on this one  
What it be like dawg, I'm on some some adope grown up type shit  
Look who I be around nigga, look who I been around nigga  
Geezy, Juve and Turk, be and Slim dawg pay attention dawg  
[Verse 1]  
Age is nothin but some digits nigga trust me on this  
Cas I think I speak for every one when I say life is a bitch  
I ride D L into the see L Gun right in my grip  
I slip a clip in every rip , cas hatas likely to trip  
Come home to my future wife and every night she'll flip  
She end up catchin rights to her lips behind diapers and shit  
But I like when we split drink henney without ice when I'm pissed  
Go to the club and start a fight thinkin I'm Tyson and shit  
But I'm a man so I'm here to handle my situtions correctly  
And i noI might be dumb but niggas gone definantly respect me  
But in the mean partner I'm fightin gun charges in court  
And in a couple of weeks our next tour about to start  
Its like i'm livin happy now  
except for the fact my daughter sayin I love you daddy now  
And that kinda juice me up and I smoke about 3 blunts  
and puff a cooler bust me up  
And say a prayer for everyday  
just so I get through the stuff but I be like  
(Chorus) - 2x  
Ahhhh man, it's complicated doin everythang on your own man  
being responsible for everybody and yo own man  
and when you feel like everythang is goin wrong man  
I'm gone stand cause I am a GROWN MAN  
[Verse 2]  
I try to keep my head up, but I die to keep my bread up  
And usually I'm fed up thinkin everythang's a set up  
But I get up this stick out my chest and clutch on my nuts  
And i get hit up with all kinda stress  
And put up wit the stuff trust me it's tough  
But I mantain to climb through it all  
And I still manage to be Lil Wayne therefore I shine and I ball  
And dawg I live for today and hope and pray that there's a tomorrow  
And I borrow confidence from out my heart when thangs get awfall  
And I'm walkin on the edge stuck without a solution  
and someway I still pick it out and shuffle to conclusion  
And I don't need nobody so keep yo advice and jus dom it  
Cas ya'll cats don't really no me ya'll jus no bout me  
So if my dawgs be on my side they keep me combile with spirit  
And plus I know my fathers watchin and my mother's the dearest  
And I ain't neva said they don't appreciate what I do  
But jus know if I wasn't a man I wouldn't make it through  
(Chorus) - 2x  
[Verse 3]  
Who would have known that this was somthin that didn't turn out so hectic  
But I chose my own life so I gradually accept it  
I'm influenced and effected by the way it became  
And I don't play with them at all so I don't say its a game  
And even though I grew up hard and I have gracefully change  
I'm always street so I'll forever be facin a change  
And I'll keep this thang brutained on the waist of my pants  
And I demand respect from all if not then I'm waisten a man  
And if I want it then I get and if I need it I have it  
Take care of my family first plus the liquor and weed is a habit  
And I'm so often I'm congratulated for the succeced at last  
But when they turn they back I just have Jesus leadin my path  
And I didn't ask for you to like me I don't care if you hate me  
But don't mistake me no otha man can neva make me or break me  
Now you faithfully inspired by the hood tell I'm gone  
And I dawg I do believe I'm grown  
so I'll be good on my own but I be like  
(Chorus) fading.......Believe Dat

Now I don't really hit the club  
But tonight I'll make an exception  
For some reason I can't seem to keep my eyes out your direction  
I'm lookin at you so hard I could probably catch a charge  
Feelin the way you walk when you move your booty applause damn,

Gotta attack my mission handle business like a soldier  
Young man, young money with the money long  
Currency tha hot spitta it so grown  
And ur perception of me is so wrong  
Don't worry bout what you heard bout me and them other birds  
Mighta dun a lil dirt and left a few of em hurt  
But whateva has occured they all got what they deserved,  
And you don't rock like them I can see it in your eyes  
If you aint good for me then you wearin a disguise

And I swore to be a player for life but I'll change for you  
  
Chorus  
  
Lil wayne

Stand out the roof of my car and flash honeys  
Take your girl to the mall and spend a gee like it's nothing  
If you lay on the floor  
Open up the spot  
Take off her draws  
Let me see the cot  
Don't stop  
Lil' Weez lil' weez and nothing nice  
But yet to my Jesus Christ  
Nothing but ice

Behind Cristal see night  
Snatch your wife  
Run up in there with the K why  
It's all mine  
Ever since I was born Wayne  
Nigga get out of line I get dirty like John Wayne  
I bought something to floss it

At first they weren't with it  
But then I was choking

[Chorus]

I tried to talk to him  
Quit talkin', I'm a hang ya by your tongue, yea

Hollerin' bullshit nigga quit the diarrhea  
Pistol lie inside of the armrest, um yes  
Lay a nigga down in his own mess, don't mess  
Playa fuck around wit' the homeless, charmless  
You can leave out here armless, no homies  
Honest, you niggas is harmless  
I'm calm as a Don is supposed to (be)  
Costa Nostra, don't ever approach him  
Don't get close to him  
Shootouts and nothin' but rock n roll to him  
Leave your blood on the dash, call it rosewood  
'Nother murder, 'nother page out the notebook  
It ain't nothin' it don't make it if you no good  
I tried to talk to him, but then a nigga had to  
  
[Chorus]  
Hit 'em up,  
Hit 'em up  
I ain't even wanna hit 'em up really,  
I was try'na be calm  
But, uh, that chopper rocked,

And man,  
I tried to talk to him,  
I tried to talk to him  
Hit 'em up,  
Hit 'em up

Cut your head off and put it on display  
Boy we find out where you live and then we invade  
Boy we do not kill no kids but your bitch dead  
Oooh, shawty like the way that you floss out  
Till I shoot you in the head, now she grossed out  
I'm the boss, you just heard it from the horse mouth  
I told a nigga count on me and niggas lost count  
This world is only preparation for the next  
Money bags under my eyes, money over rest  
Tryna get 100 M's out the alphabets  
Open up my mouth to smile, oooh treasure chest  
Oooh, DJ Stevie J keep the Glock on him  
I just bought a new .44 and I'mma proud owner  
Belfast and Monroe that was our corner  
Fuckin' fast in your ho, oooh Kowa-bunga  
Sip some lean, pop a Xan bar  
My bougie bitch pussy taste like caviar  
Once I fuck a bitch, her pussy is a landmark  
I don't know how you like your steak but I'm in rare form  
Fuck them bitchass niggas, fuck whoever care for 'em  
Momma jumped out a plane, I was airborne  
Gold watches, gold chains, watch for Leprechauns  
Favorite subject was PE, Pablo Escobar  
Kill him when he least expect it at a restaurant  
Throw him with the rest of 'em in a reservoir  
I'm the renaissance man, peep my repertoire  
Excuse my french but it's menage a trois  
Oooh, my nina Ross got a bad mouth  
Yea, I'm consuming grass like a cash cow  
Give a fuck 'bout a police with his badge out  
If you ain't got a warrant get up out my damn house  
This that Sorry 4 The Wait 2  
This an all white affair, I brought the yay through  
She said Tunechi skate through, and I'mma skate you  
I'm aimin' at your grapefruit, blaow, grape juice  
Oooh, tell them bitches free dick and blow  
Give me head, can't kiss no more  
I got free jewelry, car keys, and more  
And I just thought of robbin' like a week ago  
Hundred diamonds on my bitch, I don't bling no more

And I deserve the thrown, and if the kid ain't right,  
Then let me die in this song, see I'll be ridin' (just)  
Ridin' alone wit' my daddy on my mind like you gotta be kiddin'  
How the hell you ain't here to see ya prince do his thing  
Sometimes I wanna drop a tear but no emotions from a king  
She'll be, so I be who I be that's me

So I be who I be, that's me that's Weezy F. Baby and please say the

My fingers to the judge if the money don't move  
Then I won't budge, won't budge, no I won't budge no, na  
  
Money is the motivation  
Facin' the avenue, back touchin' the wall  
Got the weed, got the gun gotta run when I hear that bird call, dang  
Hop in that thang and merk off, swerve off  
You know me, they call me [Intro]

Feel like I been there before, my second time to the grave  
But its one life to live, that's why I'm gettin paid  
Off a flow that's priceless, I just got it appraised  
Spit like I need a raise  
Blaze as I gaze, at the stars and ask the lord  
Why the culprit at the pall pit  
It make me sick to my stomach  
That's why I rap, like a pregnant woman I don't spit I vomit  
So pay homage me and wayne two G's  
Like twenty hundreds  
And we keep the semi's blunted  
And we live like brothas from anotha  
So fuck with him and mack gonna react like you did me something  
That's a hint to you David  
Throwin shots at Goliath  
This the new testament, where the victor is tha giant  
So you should get your way and lose the hate  
Remember males shouldn't be jealous, that's a females trait

To get my spot like a polka dot. Lil' cush make my eyes and my shoulders drop,

Put the chop and the pussy in the driveway.

Bustin keys on they ass while we got paid.

Always strapped when I hit the club

And since I'm paid bitches be lovin' me

His criteria compared to John Mccain just isn't fair  
Cuz he's b-l-a-c- so the eyes are on he  
Through is pencil he write  
Legislation with the country on his mind  
And he don't cope ish  
Cuz he ain't got time  
Every second minute hour kkk wanna devour  
He got guards ready to pop him  
With their ch ch ch ch choppers  
Every brother mother sister cousin grandma wanna hump him  
Even got Hilary Clinton on the side ready to jump him  
Tell the Clintons naaaaaaaaah  
Couldn't catch him couldn't stop him  
They go by the party rules  
If you can't beat 'em you can't top 'em  
Thought you'd smack couldn't pop em  
Delegates couldn't cop 'em  
Bill Clinton couldn't help her  
Too bad she couldn't drop him  
  
Man Obama so I'll  
  
Obama goes here, Obama goes there  
Sayin' yes we can just like Michelle he sittin' in the deriere  
He travel to Arizona ready to cause some drama  
Hopin' Mccain don't comment  
Look at that bastard Obama  
He's too young he's too hip  
Negroes always causing problems  
His pale lookin' face got him lookin' like a goblin  
Mccain Mccain please don't vote for Mccain  
First they up in office talkin' bout some heart pain  
Call the ambulance quick all you hear is sirens  
His temper isn't private  
Dang I hate a mad prick  
Don't you had a mad prick  
Plus Mccains an old prick  
Barack's a yonger guy so choose him  
He's the right pick  
But if you choose the wrong pick  
Your step-son will probably end up in Iraq quick  
  
His health care plan is so immaculate  
So even if you broke you can afford to take a doc trip  
You'll be feelin' much better not sick  
And he's ok but his wife's sick  
And her back's thick and her walk's sick  
She's a fly chick  
Might hit  
  
Man obama so I'll  
  
He's makin history like x, King, and Douglas  
And rfk Obama he s that new black knew that  
Red neck said he won't beat john mccain  
He don't wear a flag and his middle name's Hussein  
But who gon' be that boy dat dat dat boy they call Obama  
Got republicans sweatin like they up in saunas  
Even Mccains 90 somethin' momma  
He ready to pull his lever every hour  
And I'd rather eat a field mouse  
Than to see John Mccain in the White House  
Vote Obama in and I promise you won't turn back  
In to some uncle Tom-as  
No Aunt Jemima or southern fried chicken  
Call him cheif obama or Mr. Keeps on tickin  
Man pass the riots comment couldn't pass his tally  
Even Oprah Winfrey said that she was right behind him  
People I say this country shol' holt without him  
But he's gotta go out relate to every body  
He do what he do like give his wife a hug then a fist dap  
Gotta do that stuff in public so the hood know that he's black  
Gotta use big words white people love to hear them  
If they hear it they don't fear him they don't know him but they feel him  
That's real

[Lil Wayne]  
Check  
Huh  
What?  
What?  
Let's go, nigga (Where you at, Wheezy?)  
You liable to catch me speedin' up the six, or beatin' up a chick  
or standin' over a stove, sweatin', heatin' up a brick  
And we keep the hustlin' slick, and got clips like bananas  
We twist the bandanas, and spit at niggas with cannons  
We ran in habitats with masks and plastic gats  
Stormin' through the house, screamin', [Cam'ron] (Spoken)  
Yo J. Are?, they've been waitin' for you dog. They've been asking.  
You ready? Dipset, Lets go! Writer  
  
[Jr Writer] [Chorus:]  
To all my hustlers, rock smugglers, stugglers  
Block bubblers, pushers, cookers pot jugglers  
What's the word y'all, Flip that herb raw  
Clap....... That's the bird-call  
  
If the cops are comin, get to hop n runnin  
Quick and drop that onion, ain't no stoppin youngin  
Put away that herb raw, let us know the word whore  
Clap........ That's the bird-call  
  
[Jr Writer]  
I still be where the weed flip, and the peas with the trees lit  
So much water in the order, it's just leaving them sea sick  
But it's me in my V6, trying to skeet on her bead lips  
They don't know, like I'm trying to keep her a secret  
Act wrong, chrome, passin me dome  
Next minute, shit I'm finished, she'll be flaggin it home  
But I always keep a straggler, that's known to bone  
And run through a lap, faster than marion jones  
Man listen, I still got them grams flippin tan pitchen,  
Corner to the damn kitchen  
Gained a couple fans having made the transition  
But I'm still in the hood like a transmission  
No cat can match me, I'm passin fastly who half as nasty  
I got it locked from here, all the way to cak-a-lacky  
But keep a mac for scrapping, thinkin it's just laffy taffy  
Shit this beat dun be the only thing clappin at me  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
[Lil' Wayne]  
Spokenyeah, I'm ready now)  
Birdman Jr. And J. Are pigeons know who they are  
Niggas gotta pay off  
Snitches know to see yall  
If chickens on the radar, I'm at it  
'cause I get it on my day off, aint nuttin like getting weighed off  
Scrape off the plates  
Shake off the flakes  
Dad daddy make all the kit kat  
I gotta lay off the way ya'll hate me like I'm adolf,  
But ya'll can't see me, Ray Charles  
I steal whores  
I'll probably take yours  
Because you peel off and I take off  
Give me no space whatever I want I takes,  
Whatever I need I bleed and see  
Bitch nigga don't breathe on the weed  
I'm fucking with them birds  
Without feeding them seeds that's creed you don't know about it,  
Full clip how I go about it, full body,  
Hard body, I'm like ya'll got it yet  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
[Cam'Ron]  
Spokenkilla, dash, hoffa, you funny nigga.)  
Damn, Homie  
In high school you was the man homie  
That's what a fan told me shiiiit  
Same old cat, get his Kangol clapped  
Brains blown back, this is dame, but dame don't rap  
Shame on black, the game's so whack  
Dame sunk some children  
From in front of yo buildin straight to a hudred million  
Bad pimpin pimpin, bad actin doggyy  
Getcha limp on pimpin, if they actin froggy  
Tell em back up off me, I come down clappin forty  
Pow that's a badder story, not in my category  
Mess around, dame held def jam down  
Supporting my back, jackin and they left their pounds  
Red-neck found, tech tech pound  
Duck duck goose, pump pump shoot,  
Shoot lets get down  
It may seem petty,  
But we all turn mean deadly  
For green-fetti,  
My whole team ready  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
[Jr Writer]  
This ain't only bars and tracks, this is for the hardest cats  
Flippin all the harder back, make them catch a heart attack  
When you see the narcs attack lemme know, start to clap, clap, clap  
But start with he deals, your pa be on chill  
The car is Deville, is real I'll  
Heart in the grill it's far in my mills  
Cruise the city with the semi or the celly  
On skinnies like I'm starving my wheels  
  
[Chorus:]

Py til I die, just beacause, pyru, b's up, bitch I'm me

Fuck with my bloods got blood on your cloths  
And I'm blooded soooowooo (2)  
  
Once again it's on, yea I'm back in the booth  
Stand at the top like a tac in the roof  
Still on these hoes like a mack in a suit  
Still on my toes not a crack in my shoe  
Rappers talkin about me but I don't give a hoot  
These niggas still lyin I'm the muthafukin truth  
Talk tough till I knock off your kuff  
And I own my team, I'm like a Maloof  
They hatin on me I'm just tryin to be weezy  
Just like young jeezy in lambobingghini  
Smoked out my mind baby and now I'm seein threebies  
Dope boy fresh from my fitted to my dc  
All red so these hoes know who we be

Pop pop flow yea ya'll niggas sweet peas  
Gettin high on a yacht call it see me

Yea, I advance my flow and they must like that  
They like it so much, they say they wright that  
Barkin at the dog, but I don't bite back  
I aint cpr I aint bringin they life back  
Bad cpr bad bitch on a bite back  
Skittles on my wrist, yea nigga the bright pack  
Ima shine, I live witha light hat  
Airforce fly call me a night jet  
Brand new coupe same color as the sky  
The dash same too, lord know I'm gon try  
Cop pull me over lord know I'm gon lie  
They go up in my trunk lord know I'm gon fry  
Them niggas throwin salt all over my fries  
So ima just walk all over them guys  
Niggas throwin darts never hit the bullseye  
Young money bitch new orleans east side  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Yea, been around the world rep the same thang  
Been around the world it's the same gang  
B's up B's up flame gang braa braa braaa braaa bang bang  
I tol my homie streets can't sleep on life  
So he popped the X pill and didn't sleep all night  
I aint worried bout you I'm just tryin do me  
Last album did 2 I'm just tryin do 3  
I am what every pair of eyes oughta see  
Bitches just wish they could call a art of me  
My momma used to tell me just get a 9 to 5  
Cash money made her say never mind I'm fine  
(B's up!)  
  
[Chorus:]

The streets make the hustlas  
Hustlas make the world go round  
The world is made of keys, ounces and pounds  
The keys, ounces and pounds is made from hustlas  
See how shit come back round for ya  
Gotta cop it, chop it and cook it  
See how shit come back round for ya  
Gotta kick in the oven now watch it bubble  
And you can knock on my door  
But you can't knock the hustle  
But I- it's like a game of twenty-one and I got nineteen  
And my Jake but I put more 'd' on me  
Lil' Weezy Wee gon' eat that's how it is  
Got insurance on the floor man I'm that positive  
And I'm shaggy in the saggy lens  
Me an my squad in the paddy wagon tally Benz  
And you know I put the mags on that  
.45 mack with the flash on that  
Who want it  
Everybody sing along  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
Now I'm a ride 'cause I got riding in my bloodline  
And I'm a shine 'cause I got shining in my bloodline  
I get that dough 'cause I got hustle in my bloodline  
I bleed concrete  
  
And when I move, I move out with the raw  
I move out with the squad  
To his album we ride we so mob  
I throw lives and lowest to live  
For my loaf of bread the people's player  
I did what the culture said  
And I live by the coast of Nostre Cid  
Fuck around I'll knock your shoulder from your head  
Get it right I'm a soldier till I'm dead  
This kid is white with buttonholes inside that bled  
I'm pumping O's with lots of hay  
I'm so high and really I don't even know why  
And oh I just go buy a whole house  
And lay my mat down lay her back down  
But I never put my mack down  
You see the thug in me  
You know Weezy he the young son of Bubba-be  
Buy my basketball shorts with a thunder be  
If you want it then come to me  
I'm right here  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
I'm G'd up  
Only follow the code of the streets  
Live bad to die good  
Know how to move when hustling by the days with no food  
But just so I can eat  
And ain't it a bitch  
And if you see me getting fat I'm probably getting rich  
And you probably can see me for some crack before six  
And after that it's all bricks  
A fake and my palm is wrapped around this eight  
And my arm because the dirty south is straight Vietnam  
I skate with the bomb  
I'm asking you don't play with me at all  
Shots hit your ass and make three of y'all  
It'll take three of y'all to fill one of my shoe prints  
Cause I did and do shit that's better than new shit  
Fit for two clips  
The kid is a nuisance  
Aw man, he's inspired by his own gangsta music  
And the Blueprint  
Cruising through stoop with the ewe lit  
Like ooh shit this is more than weed, it's 500 Degreez  
  
[Chorus: x2]

Yeah  
Put my shades on  
  
Uh, I live it up in these like my last days  
If time is money, I'm an hour past paid  
Ugh, gunpowder in my hourglass  
Niggas faker than some flour in a powder bag  
Yeah, I put it down like my hands hurting  
I'm on a natural high, but I land perfect  
Some of us are lovers, most of y'all haters  
But I put up a wall, and they just wallpaper  
So love or hate me, I stay hate-free  
They say we learn from mistakes, well that's why they mistake me  
I got some weight on my shoulders, to me it's like feathers  
All hail Weezy, call it bad weather  
I stick to the script, I memorize the lines  
'Cause life is a movie that I've seen too many times  
You're on the outside looking in, close the blinds  
And they say never say never, but fuck your never mind  
I've been gone too long  
True or false, right or wrong, haha  
Hello Weezy, welcome home

Cut the bullshit out, I'm Edward with the scissors  
Life is a choice, and death is a decision  
Times have changed, but fuck it get a new watch  
I still got the vision like a line between two dots  
Young money's eating, the label getting fatter  
And yea, the tables turned, but I'm still sitting at 'em  
I'm a bad motherfucker, 'cause the good die young  
Everybody selling dreams, I'm too cheap to buy one  
Man when that cookie crumble, everybody want a crumb  
Shoot that hummingbird down, hummingbird don't hum yeah  
Big money, big money, deep pockets  
Money talks, and motherfuckers eavesdropping  
Bunch of bloods, you could call it blood clotting

See y'all dead meat, and me I'm just a butcher  
I do it for the money, man I am such a hooker  
And freedom was my girl, until they fucking took her  
You can look into the future, its right behind your eyelids  
But I don't wanna know, 'cause shit I like surprises  
Why that, why this, why you on that why shit?  
Motherfucker ask me why, I say Y-M

Digged in my pocket, pulled out the party  
Be cool before you get stomped and pulled out the party

Lookin for a bad bitch, I give her dinosaur dick  
Lyrics courtesy of killerhiphop.com  
Big bad flow Weezy, fuck the polices

Vince Young, suicide doors, haha,  
Life's a bitch, now die for her.  
  
I have the type of flow n-ggas don't have to like,  
My rhymes is ambidextrous so I don't have to write,  
The way I'm eating n-ggas wish they had my appetite,  
Straight up out of Texas and I'm major like apple white,  
I pour four then hit the exit door,  
Take a trip to Macy's cop the whole second floor,  
Hood smell the scent of money coming out my pours,  
Yeah my pockets full of dead people like a morgue, bore,  
I made it from a flyer to the forbes, (see me)  
Young Elvis Freshly, yes he flyer than the store,  
Dropping babys out and your chicks cheek, kicks neat,  
Got your son looking up to me like I'm 6 feet,  
Lyrics courtesy of killerhiphop.com  
Your daughter need someone to save her, not me,  
I'm knocking hoes down like Laila Ali,  
Try he and imma put the toaster to ya kidney,  
Then I pull off in a Bentley top open like a chimney,  
Damn, its no ceilings like a Colosseum,  
Candy slab, paint dripping like gonorrhea,  
The way Im leaning Ima nod if I stand still  
Flow harder than an anvil,  
Short (short)  
  
Ok, its Gudda hoe,  
All about my bills like buffalo,  
Your b-tch under my sheets,

Purple got me moving slow,  
Like I'm in a snail race,  
Pop pop pop 3 shots to the head,  
Then I pick up my shell case,  
Leave em with a pale face,  
Yes, I am a young money goon,  
Your girl like a motion picture she gon be coming soon,  
I do a certain rule, I pop her like balloons,  
I pass her off to Mills then drop her off the tune,  
Couple screws lose, you wanna play with him,  
This is No Ceilings b-tch, roofless like a stadium,  
We shut down every f-cking spot these b-tches see us in,  
You want us in your club well n-gga pay us then,  
All grey BM, Im getting from my baby M,  
She told me get the money and count it for me when I rake it in,  
Don't play no games hoe,

Cause they tryin' to tame us, but we brainless  
And just think, I'm one sell out record away from being famous  
Shit I guess I ain't it  
You could paint it how you may,  
But I remain this gangsta 'til the day I lay  
Where the worms stay  
I spit it for my nigga's sake  
I spit it for myself a long time ago  
Got a few houses, few whips, few condos  
I'm so straight I'm pointin'  
The game is hurtin', and baby boy the ointment  
Baby boy the president now  
Shit you gotta make an appointment  
Two record labels  
You should come join 'em  
Do check the label  
And make sure it's yellow or Roze  
'fore you bring it to my table  
  
[Chorus]  
Gansta's don't die,  
They get chubby and they move to Miami, I move to Miami

Gansta's don't die,  
They get chubby and they move to Miami, I move to Miami  
I'm banned from Wet Willies, but a nigga like fuck it  
I'm still a G, thuggin' out in public, straight up

Nigga playin', doing about one eighty  
Maserati, matchin' drop top sun shade  
Gotta be fly, P-one nigga, spent about five on a condo high in the sky  
G-four whenever, fly in any weather  
Had to pop a few pussies that was bad feathers  
Million on the floor  
Thats fo' sho' that lil' homie got the flow, so we all just goin' float  
And don't think about the past  
A little water came, now we floatin' on everything  
Niggas doing about anything, killin' while they hustlin'  
Niggas puttin' it in for the change  
So we headed to the game, Culpepper gettin' his roll on  
I'm on the side with that bling  
And outside, got them thangs  
Them Phantoms out there, we do it up, switchin' lanes  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Na, don't fuck with that dog

And I'm coming back hard  
Stunner get me to work, and I'm runnin' that off

With a swagger you can't get, na you can't get it  
Shit, bitch I pop like Diddy,

And you still drawing Leonardo D'Vinci  
  
Trap me, I'm in there early, gettin' money ridin' dirty  
Uptown puttin' in down blowin' out the pound  
Duffel bag full of cash when I come around  
The lil' homie got the game so I put him down  
Hold my town, world wide wearin' a crown  
Like father like son, got it off the mound  
Like father like son, niggas stand their grounds  
Like father like son, nigga fuck them clowns

Give a woman none, uh-huh  
I already gave my brother some, it's my sister turn  
Ain't it funny how the fish do burn  
But your boy just relax like a fresh new perm  
At the world in the barrel of the pistol term  
Well we get it how we live never live and learn  
Gotta talk about the flow cause you is concerned  
Only down south rapper could've been in tha firm  
Or the commissioner of Wu-Tang nigga  
Tryna tell you I can kick it like Liu Kang nigga  
Got the Sub-Zero flow how you want me ma  
Nigga get over here like Scorpion

Where's my coffee?  
Good morning doctor carter (hey sweetie)  
Looks like its going to be a long day. (another one what we got?)  
Your first patient (yeah)  
Is suffering from a lack of concept (uh-huh)  
Originality (ugh)  
His flow is weak (another one)  
And he has no style (ugh)  
What'cha got for um?  
  
OK, let me put my gloves on and my scrubs on.  
Dr.carter to the rescue.  
Excuse me if I'm late,  
But like a thief it takes time to be this great  
Ha! so just wait, your style is a disgrace,  
Your rhymes are fifth place and I'm just grace.  
One, uno, ace and I'm tryin' to make your heart beat like bass,  
But your sweet like cake and I come to fix  
Whatever you shall break.  
Where is your originality?  
You are so fake so picture me like a gallery.  
Capture what I say.  
All I need is one mic.  
All I need is one take.  
Like hey, brighter then the sun ray got a pistols on the playground.  
Watch the gun-play like.  
No kidding, no kids in the way,  
But the kids do watch.  
Gotta watch what we say.  
Gotta work everyday.  
Gotta not be cliche.  
Gotta stand out like Andre 3k.  
Gotta kick it kick it like the sensei.  
You gotta have faith you gotta gotta wait wait  
Think I think I lost 'em  
  
Good afternoon doctor carter  
Nurse  
I don't know about this one  
His confidence is down  
Vocab and metaphors needs work  
And he lost respect for the game  
Ah let me see  
Think you can save him?  
  
OK.  
Respect is in the heart.  
So that's where I'm a start.  
And a lot of heart patients don't make it.  
Now hey kid  
Plural I graduated  
Cause you could get through anything if magic made it.  
And that was called recycling  
Or re-reciting  
Something cause you just like it  
So you say it just like it.  
Some say its biting  
But I say its enlightening  
Besides, Dr. Kanye West is one of the brightest.  
And Dr. Swizz can stitch your track up the tightest.  
And Dr. Jeezy can fix your back up the nicest.  
Arthritis in my hand from writing.  
But I'm a doctor they don't understand my writing.  
So I stop writing.  
Now I'm like lighting.  
And you ain't Vince Young so don't clash with the titans.  
Fast and exciting.  
My passion is frighting.  
Now let me put some more vocab in your i.v.  
Here take this Vicodin  
Like it and love it  
And confidence has no budget  
So pay me no mind  
I don't walk like I talk it cause I'm running  
I don't do it cause I done it and I'm in the emergency unit  
God damn it I've lost another one  
  
Good evening doctor carter its been a long day  
But this one looks much better then the others  
His respect is back up  
Concepts sound good his style is showing strong signs of improvement  
All he needs now is some swagger  
OK let me take my gloves off then  
  
Swagger tighter then a yeast infection.  
Fly go hard like geese erection.  
Fashion patrol police detection.  
I stay tight like Chinese connection.  
I stay tight like pussy at night.  
Baby don't get me wrong I could do that pussy right.  
But I'm too wrong to write.  
Too fresh to fight.  
Too paid to freestyle.  
Too paid to freestyle.  
I had to say it twice  
Swagger so nice.  
And don't ask me shit unless it concern a price.  
And I don't rap fast I rap slow.  
Cause I mean every letter in the words in the sentence of my quotes.  
Swagger just flow sweeter then honey oats.  
That swagger I got it I wear it like a coat.  
Wait, as I put the light down his throat.  
I can only see flow.  
His blood starting to flow.  
His lungs starting to grow.  
This one starting to show.  
Strong signs of life.  
Wheres the stitches here's the knife.  
Smack his face his eyes open I reply what a night.  
Welcome back hip hop I saved your life.  
  
He looks good  
His vitals are up  
He's looking good  
He's looking good  
I think we got one  
Doctor carter I think we got one  
Yup we got one  
We saved him  
He's good  
He's good  
We got one  
He's good  
He's good  
We got 'em  
He's a go  
He's good

[Intro]  
Turn the music down in my headphones,  
(Yeah) that noise in the background that's my skateboard...  
That nigga Mack crazy...  
  
[Verse]  
I put my shooters on they feet  
I just give em' yo address and go to sleep  
The money turn my niggas into monsters  
The white don' turned my niggas into Nazi's lord  
The money turn my face into a stocking  
Don't make me Turn yo baby to a hostage boyyy  
Don't make me turn the kid to a Foster  
My Woman turn my dick into a mazda lord  
Body ports in the duffel, the bullets turn your body to a puzzle  
The money turn my bitch into a monster she know how to get a check and turn a
0 to a comma lord  
The money turn my niggas into killas  
The sugar turned the cocaine to Vanilla  
The money turned the bitches into hoes  
The money turned my niggas into foes lord...  
I put my shooters on they feet  
Give em' yo address and I go out to eat  
Had that Snowman in the hood like Jody Breeze  
She from the hood but look like she from overseas  
I say I got ice in my veins, blood in my eyes  
Hate in my heart, love in my mind  
I seen nights full of pain, days are the same  
You keep the sunshine, save me the rain  
I search but never find, hurt but never cry  
I work and forever try, but I'm cursed, so never mind  
And it's worse, but better times seem further and beyond  
The top gets higher the more that I climb  
The spot gets smaller, and I get bigger  
Tryna get into where I fit in, no room for a nigga  
But soon for a nigga it be on, mu'fucka'  
Cause all the bullshit, it made me strong, mu'fucka'  
  
Pick the world up and I'm a drop it on your fuckin' head, yeah  
Bitch, I'm a pick the world up and I'm a drop it on your fuckin' head  
And I could die now, rebirth motherfucker  
Hop up in my spaceship and leave Earth, motherfucker  
I'm gone  
Motherfucker, I'm gone  
  
Uh, I know what they don't wanna tell you  
Just hope you're heaven-sent, and you're hell-proof  
I-I walk up in the world and cut the lights off  
And confidence is a stain they can't wipe off  
Huh, my word is my pride  
But wisdom is bleak, and that's a word from the wise  
Served to survive, murdered and bribed  
And when it got too heavy I put my burdens aside  
  
So I could pick the world up  
And drop it on yo fuckin' head, haha  
Bitch, I'm a pick the world up  
And I'm a drop it on your fuckin' head, yeah  
And I could die now, rebirth motherfucker  
Hop up in my spaceship and leave Earth, motherfucker  
I'm gone  
Motherfucker, I'm gone (I'm gone)  
  
It hurts, but I never show,  
This pain you'll never know  
If only you could see just how lonely and how cold  
And frostbit I've become, my back's against the wall  
When push come to shove, I just stand up and scream [Bridge 1: Lil Wayne]  
I woke up in that pussy and starting stroking  
You woke up and said [hook:]  
If I don't nothin' I'm a ball  
I'm countin' all day like a clock on the wall  
Now go and get your money little duffle bag boy  
Said go and get your money little duffle bag boy get money  
And I ain't ever ran from a nigga and I  
Damn sho' ain't bout to pick today to start runnin'  
Look honey I ain't never ran from a nigga and I  
Damn sho' ain't bout to pick today to start runnin' get money  
  
The beat so hot the flow is so ice cold  
Walkin' to the Gucci store honey I'm home  
I am on my shit I need a pamper on me  
Toilet paper on the side for example homie  
I, get, money  
I know you niggas ain't heard no shit like this and  
While you wishing on that fallin' star I'm in a foreign car  
Smoking out with the doors ajar  
Suede sun roof hangin' out the big top  
We leave the dealership head to the rim shop  
You niggas barely dressin' I got thousands piling  
That's that salad dressin' I'm on my thousand island  
Wildin' stylin' I be I get so much money its my i.d  
Don't try me and if I dont do nuthin' I'm a fuckin' ball  
And I ain't bout to start runnin' naw nigga naw  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Ain't nothin' to a boss we ballin' when you see us  
We hear them haters callin' they too far off to see us  
Unless they got they glasses on get your bifocal game  
Class is now in session now try to stay focus mane  
Your boy ain't good enough style ain't hood enough  
Would've could've should've wont do with us true enough  
Need a hoe break a hoe never nuthin' new to us  
Turnin' hoes to house wives never been cool with us  
Soon enough all these dealers are gonna catch up  
Till then fuck it I'm winnin' so I'm a stack up  
Flows like a river the current is so rapid  
Hit with the ratchet thats how shit happens  
Next time you're yappin' make sure it be about that big money talk  
Let that lil' money walk call me what you want but don't call me for front  
Southside I got what you want come holla at me  
  
[Chorus: x2]

When I say I don't give a fuck  
I mean that yeah  
When them niggas brains is getting bust  
I done seen that yeah  
If a shipment was coming in  
I need a lot of that wodie  
I need a sixty-forty nigga  
And no chargin' that wodie  
You done heard about Michael Jackson  
And shiggidy shit  
But you ain't never heard about me  
When I'm flissin a bitch  
Niggas shoulders gettin knocked  
Clean off of they head  
See that red dot comin from  
Me and my girlfriend  
Cause I wants mine  
I needs mine  
And I'm about to get mine  
At these times  
Look lil' daddy  
You ain't got to worry about none of these other niggas  
You needs to be worried about when Juvi comin to get ya  
Look, I make a phone call to the big dog  
Y'all bitches better handle y'all business before I hit y'all  
Even though a nigga rich and I rock ice  
I still bust a nigga head on the block aright  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
It's enemy turf that I'm on  
So I'ma play it how it go  
Cock the hollow points  
And tote my black calicoe  
My lil' brother Weezy  
(My big brother Juvi)  
(Four hit the blocks)  
(Strapped up with the Uzis)  
  
What, What, La  
Gun for gun  
Eye for eye  
Better move yo' wife and son  
Cause I ride or die  
Cash money Hot Boy  
Bless me when I'm gone  
But until then load up the chrome cause it's on  
I been bout it  
Put a four up in my lip and put my dirty up in the clip  
I drop the top and then I flip I hit his cock and make 'em flip  
And I be full of that trash  
I be the first one to jump out the jag bust at 'em fast  
Watch the bullets chop off the head  
And make 'em fall in the grass  
One move they all die  
Lil' Weezy small frie  
Gorilla when it's war time  
Y'all better learn  
When this nigga shoot it'll be all hell  
Well then let 'em burn  
Hold him for ransom hear him this morning  
Seven churn and I be damn if I let 'em go  
If I don't get my dough  
Then hell will be all blowin'  
'Till I R.I.P C-M-R I be  
I put it down for all my peeps  
Nigga, I'm H-B for real  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
All I know is the streets  
And how to strap up  
When it's time shoot it  
Cock yo' heaters  
Tie up yo' bags  
It's time to do it  
Blaze the blunt  
Shut off the lights  
And cut down the music  
Roll down the windows  
Turn the corner  
And let loose with the,  
If ya don't know now  
Then ya never will learn  
You ca play with Lil' Wayne  
And yo' block get burned  
You must love to go swimming  
Cause the water gets deeper  
See I bust you wide open  
And take 'ya daughter with me  
Here come the beat boy  
Shoot out the street lights  
Time to bring on the heat boy  
If you ain't really wit it  
Then you better get back  
I open yo' chest  
And make it look just like a wet cat  
This is a death trap  
I'm a guerrilla and I mean it  
Leave ya' head still in a beanin'  
Not on the cement  
Calicoe steamin'  
Red dot beamin'  
Dressed up suspicious  
Play with Lil Weezy you'll be dinner for the fishes  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Enemy Turf  
Time to strap up  
What

I know, I know, Weezy Wee, this dedicated to my father  
Rabbit nigga, y'all excuse the expressions  
  
What it be like up there baby boy,  
Aye this here ya son hollerin' at ya  
I miss the shit out ya, it's hard to be without ya  
But I know you watchin', peepin down on how I'm livin'  
Aye, tell Jesus I said thanks for the blessings he sendin'  
Please ask him to forgive me for the sins I commit  
Just let him know I'm still young and at risk  
Say, I'll never forget the time  
That you caught me smokin' herb in the house  
I was dead wrong, I deserved to get out  
But you just talked it over with my mom  
And got it situated in due time  
Told me get the paper instead of high  
So now I take that advice and shed light over my whole life dog  
I wanted to be just like you my whole life dog  
I can't believe them niggas stole ya, that shit's pain to me  
But don't trip, I hold you down, you still remain through me  
And dog I know I can't see you but I bet that you smilin  
And I'm a make you even happier, I promise  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
I know you can't be close to my nigga, I know  
But I know you watchin' over me nigga, I know  
But the shit's steady hurtin', burn deep  
But it's alright dog, everything gon' be alright dog  
  
I know you see my daughter growin' up and bad as ever  
But she cool 'cause she do whatever daddy tell her  
And your wife, she's still the most wonderful woman  
I just built her a new house, she ain't runnin' from nothin'  
B and Slim, them niggas still love me like they own child  
Ms. Rose nerves get bad, but still she gon' smile  
And me I'm on some squad shit and some debate it  
But I know they love it way more than they hate it  
And I know you probably laughin' at the way I treat these hoes and these  
Bitches,  
I try love 'em, my BM be trippin'  
But Rabbit, you know one thing, I got the game from you, every perspective  
That's why I keep the gun at close connection for protection  
And you see I left school behind and chose C-M-B  
It was impossible on the road every week, but I know enough  
And I follow by everything you ever told me, think wisely  
Watch over me my nigga, just guide me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I swear to you man, at some times I really wish I was with you  
'Cause I get fed up with this life and I miss you  
Somebody pass me a tissue, and let me wipe the tears from my eyes  
Yeah, nigga I cried, it's 'cause I loved you dog  
I promise I won't ever put nothin' above you dog  
So I live my life in dedication of you dog  
I know you see me happy on the outside and hurt within  
Make me want to grab that gun and burst again  
But I know they got a reason why I'm here  
And I know they got a reason why you gone  
And therefore, I'm succeedin' on my own  
But you ain't never left me, nigga, you still dwell in my heart  
I can't forget you kept it real from the start  
And until my last breath I exhale, I'm a keep you with me  
And when we do meet again, I'm a keep you with me  
And tell them niggas Pac, B.I.G. and Pun I said I'm the Fireman

Ski Mask spending next weeks cash, he fast  
And I don't even need a G pass I'm pass that  
I'm passin' 'em out now and you can't have that  
And my chain Toucan Sam that  
Tropical colors you can't match that  
Gotta be abstract  
You catch my gal legs open better smash that  
Don't be surprise if she ask where the cash at  
I see she wearing them jeans that show her butt crack  
My girls can't wear that why that's where my stash at

And I'm a fool with the flame and the caine  
Cut it just a little bit but the drain stay the same yeah

Licking all on her lips, cause she love how I taste

Give it to ya from the back and make you cough up a lung  
Or give a little brain and cough up a sun  
I bust two times and then I toss up a one  
Now shake it baby, it took your momma 9 months to make you baby  
Enter the bedroom, we won't make a baby  
Get your kneee pads on, no skating baby  
So get your aprons baby,  
She said, I think it's a boy, she ate the baby  
  
Now go down girl, give head, go down Go down girl, give head, go down Now go

[Lil' Wayne]  
Okay, I'm talkin' about a  
Good girl, gone bad  
Crooked world, wrong path  
Right Mom, wrong Dad  
I sing this song mad, but not mad enough to shoot you  
But it just eats me up, like some bbq from Luther's  
In the mornin' with the roosters  
On the corner with the boosters  
And she's the freshcut and they're on her like sutures  
And I wanna talk to her  
But her Mama has to school her  
I wanna see her better  
She's the weather of my future  
I don't wanna see another hurricane  
Baby you can kill the pain  
If you just let me explain  
Trust me I know what I'm sayin'  
You will end up on the track of an oncoming train  
Stuck in the passenger seat  
Travlin' through the fast lane  
  
[Bun B]  
Well once upon a time, there was a Mom and a Dad  
Who on the outside had everything people wished they had  
A beautiful daughter, two story house, two car garage  
And a white picket fence wrapped around the front yard  
See Daddy was a doctor  
And Mommy was a banker  
Mommy's job got outsourced  
So now Mommy's dranker  
Daddy had a malpractice suit  
Now he's a snorter  
And all this shit's takin' place  
Right in front of their daughter  
She says, I hate gossip,  
And I don't walk around looking for it, you know?  
But yesterday it seemed to just wander until it found me,  
You know like,  
Gossip found me  
Then why don't you just provin' it  
How? You don't know how to prove it?,  
Well, what you just do is.  
  
Stop, hatin' on a nigga  
That is a weak emotion  
The lady of a nigga  
And you could get tipped  
Like ya waitin' on a nigga,  
Put a body bag and an apron on a nigga  
  
I give my all behind the mic,  
But you could never see, if you sit behind the light  
You don't have to pick me, to win the title fight  
But I'm a wear that championship belt so tight  
And if I'm wrong, there is no right  
And if I'm wrong, there is no white  
I'm tryna be po-lite,  
but you bitches in my hair like the fucking Po-lice  
My flow is rare, these other rappers nice,  
These other rappers bark,  
Some of em' even bite  
But I'm much more bright  
I give the game sight  
So before you dim the light you just might, might, wanna  
  
Think it over (think it over) ooh  
Think it over (think it over) baby baby  
  
Stop, analyzin' critacizin',  
You should realize what I am and start epidamizin'  
Legitimate, I got the heart of the biggest lion  
I'm confident like fuck 'em all pull out my dick and ride it  
My flow sick, so sick, it's like my shit is dyin'  
It rains a lot in my city, because my citys cryin'  
because my citys dyin'  
But I emerge from all of that, I am a livin pio-neer, sighin'  
Fear God, not them  
Steer my Robin Coupe through the streets of the booth and  
Soo-woo  
And, then I leek a tub in the boot, I leave a blood bath,  
Sorry there's a tub in the boot, now where the drugs at?  
I'm twisted like the strings on a shoe  
No nigga fuck that  
I'm twisted like the strings on a boot,  
Now where New Orleans at?  
I feel hip hop stole me like a bus pass  
So in your possession, I, I must ask  
  
Hey, haven't I been good to you? (Think it over)  
Tell me, haven't I been sweet to you?  
  
Drag my name through the mud  
I come out clean  
Cast away stones  
I won't even blink  
A gun is not a math problem,  
I won't even think  
Just leave you dead like the meat under my sink  
Don't believe in me  
Don't believe me  
I've graduated from hungry,  
And made it to greedy  
My flow is like pasta  
Take it and eat it  
But I'm a need cheese if I'm bakin' a ziti  
You niggas want beef?  
I want a steak in the weed B  
Lost in Amsterdam or Jamaica where weed be  
Hard body nigga, takin' it easy  
All about my paper, bout my paper like Eazy  
Why do rappers, lot of rappers, lot of fans, lot of rappers, lot of rappers  
Lie like actin', cut the motherfuckin' cameras  
Cut the check, nigga fuck your pops  
And make it out to Mr. Hip Hop  
  
I'm not dead, I'm alive  
  
And I ain't dead I'm alive

And she blows it at the end  
She keeps talking to me,  
'Cause she knows that I'm a friend  
But I can't keep hearing it over and over again  
I was the one that you came to  
When you broke up with your boyfriend

Girl I was the one, that told you fuck them other niggas  
And you still with fuck them other niggas  
Most people learn from the bad things  
I hope that you learn  
And don't crash and burn in the fast lane  
But if you read this letter then you caught me  
This should explain all the ways that you taught me  
  
How to hate a bitch  
That owe you everything  
At least a wedding ring  
Moving on to better things  
So don't you call me talking 'bout them other fools

The fact that you saw the world affected all your decisions  
But it wasn't your fault, wasn't in your intentions  
To be the one here talking to me, be the one listening  
  
But I admire your poppin' bottles and dippin'  
Just as much as you admire bartending and strippin'  
Baby, so don't be mad, nobody else trippin'  
You see a lot of crooks and the crooks still crook

Never really had luck, couldn't never figure out

Y tu tan inocente me tenias locamente enamorado, me tenias locamente

Y ya lo ves, lo que fue ya fue te marchaste poco a poco de mi lado y yo sigo
locamente enamorado aqui sigo locamente enamorado.  
Te fuiste pero nunca me dijiste adios me dejaste en mil pedazos por no saber

Yeah, hello  
Get lifted  
Yeah, I get lifted  
Yeah, yeah, so get lifted yup! Haha  
  
I am sittin' on the clouds, I got smoke comin' from my seat  
I can play basketball with the moon, I got the whole world at my feet  
Playin' touch football, on marijuana street  
Or, in a marijuana field, you are so beneath my cleets  
Get high, so high, that I feel like lying  
Down in a cigar, roll me up and smoke me 'cause  
(I feel like dying)  
  
Only once the drugs are done, that I feel like dying I feel like dying  
Only once the drugs are done, that I feel like dying I feel like dying  
(I feel like, I feel like, I feel like)  
  
Swimming laps around a bottle of Louis the Thirteenth  
Jumpin' off of a mountain into a sea of Codeine  
I'm at the top of the top, but still I climb  
And if I should ever fall, the ground would then turn to wine  
Pop, pop, I feel like flying, then I feel like frying, then  
(I feel like dying)  
  
Only once the drugs are done, that I feel like dying I feel like dying  
Only once the drugs are done, that I feel like dying I feel like dying  
(I feel like, I feel like, I feel like)  
  
I can mingle with the stars, and throw a party on Mars  
I am a prisoner, locked up behind Xanax bars  
I have just boarded a plane, without a pilot  
And violets are blue, roses are red  
Daisies are yellow, the flowers are dead  
Wish I can give you this feeling I feel like buying  
And if my dealer don't have no more, then  
(I feel like dying)  
  
Only once the drugs are done, that I feel like dying I feel like dying  
Only once the drugs are done, that I feel like dying I feel like dying

[Birdman]  
Priceless, fresh off an island, hundred mill  
Bitch we the bidness, 5 star gangsta, mula, crazy

She was the sweetest ever  
Whatever happened to forever  
She never say never, she rather say whatever  
I'd rather stay together and she'd rather chase the devil  
Now I'm left to race the rebel  
Bartender make it several  
Turn up the bass and treble  
How bout I make it metal  
I'm such a fatal fellow  
And she's the reason why  
Because without the muthafucker I'd die  
I'd die, I'd die  
So bury me today or tomorrow  
'Cause I've buried myself away  
In the sorrow in may  
I die before I wake  
I pray I'm resurrected for her nightmares sake  
  
But you love me  
At least that's what she said  
That whole weekend in my bed  
But there was a speaker in my head  
Saying I stepped on a flower, foot on the petal  
Good wasn't home, so I settled for better  
I'm on my way to get it, but get it got shot  
So I guess I gotta work with the little bit I got  
Now I'm like Yea, yea, yea, yea  
This is the Carter motherfucker, yea  
And in my building I must keep it real  
  
And man I miss the times, we would shine, you would keep on your side  
You would teach me how to ride and you would teach me how to pry  
Then we get on the line and go over our lines  
We were in the same position and that's when you change position, shit  
I never change and I miss ya, and its strange but I never forget ya  
Throw that at you and them bitches homie  
And I know that ain't you wit that dissing on me  
That's why I never replied and never will just let em live phony  
If ya ever died I swear to God I got yo kids homie  
What's mine is their I gotta give homie, and yea  
We still a army in this bitch homie  
Yea Cash Money still the shit homie, shit homie  
What's really real is you feeling me nigga  
That Hot Boy shit still in me nigga, word the giggity nigga  
And I ain't got time to speak the history  
I miss you and I know you missing  
Gizzle but  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
Man I miss my dogs(yea)  
Many nights club popping(yea)  
Many nights we were blowing trees(yea)  
Many nights we were hustling(yea)  
Man I miss my dogs(yea)  
Me and you through thick and thin(yea)  
Me and you through the very end(yea)  
For only you I was in the game(yea)  
  
And I remember when you came to the click  
I had already made my name in the click, but you got famous and shit  
I got my soldier rag and dangled my shit  
I was down to just to hang wit you shit  
And I banged to the boogie bang bang wit yo click  
And I ain't even from the 3(3rd Ward), my hood was angry at me, shit  
But I rose to my feet, played the post wit the heat  
At them shows while you performed and posed  
I was waiting for a nigga to jump, see I was patient but was ready to duck  
Cause you my brother chump  
Real Gs never buckle up  
But every family ain't filled wit gangstas that's real  
And that's real and I would never turn my back or turn ya down  
Even if you turned around motherfucker  
But history is history  
I miss you and I know you missing me  
Juve but  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
You was my nigga, my nerd, my joy, my herb  
My main motherfucking man Turk  
My other, my partner, I was teacher, he was father  
I skilled, he schooled, we chilled, we moved  
We thug, we hung, we ate, we slept  
We lived, we died, I stayed, you left  
Remember how we played to the left  
And we stayed out of trouble 'cause we stayed to our self  
Member B and Slim leaving, hand the ki's over  
Tell me not to go Uptown and we went straight to tha Nolia  
While I watched you reunite wit yo soljas  
And yo mom and brothers, while I lied to the stunna  
Yea those were the times my brother  
Now I recognize real and I honor my brother  
Yea nigga sub mage my brother, the Sqad's my brother  
The nigga you left behind is my brothers  
  
[Chorus: x2]

And tuck your tongue right back in,
